	(2, 'CentCom', 'Governments: The Wizard\'s Federation', '> `GREETINGS. WE\'RE THE WIZARDS OF THE WIZARD\'S FEDERATION.`\n- The last recorded message prior to the complete \n  and utter vaporization of Space Station 08.\n***\n\nThe Space Wizard Federation is a collective of magic users, known to operate within the Spinward sector, and suspected of existing galaxy-wide. Wild claims have been made about their effects on human society, even before the age of spaceflight, with some claiming that every negative event, every dictator, and every freak accident can be traced back to the influence of a Wizard.\n\nIt is speculated as to whether or not Wizards actually can cast magic- the more cynical among normal humanity insist that magic does not exist, and that anything the Wizards do that appears to be magical is simply sophisticated technology masquerading as true spellcasting. Many do not care, however, as no matter whether it is real or fake, it works, and will kill just fine.\n\nRecently, the Wizard Federation has been in a state of quasi-Cold War with Nanotrasen, for reasons that can only be speculated at. What does matter is that stations throughout the Spinward sector have been attacked by Wizards, and the sight of a blue hat and robes is rapidly becoming as dreaded by NT employees as the blood-red gear of the Syndicate. Survivors of these attacks could give no reasons as to why the Wizards were there, and what their true motives (should any exist) could be.\n\nOn a deeply classified level, Nanotrasen\'s higher ups try to maintains some contact with the Wizard Federation diplomatically, but very little has come of their efforts to talk, and the attacks ebb and wane with no relation to diplomacy. No one knows exactly what compels a Wizard into membership of the Federation, as not all magic users are members- occasionally, a friendly Wizard has been known to show up at station, performing parlor tricks and sharing tall tales of their adventures in exchange for the hospitality of the crew (which they seldom find, due to an uncompromising "shoot first, second, third, and last" policy on NT\'s part towards magic). Due to the actions of its members, many suspect that the Wizard Federation is joined only by the worst of the magic casting community- those who live for chaos, and will find any opportunity to wave their magic dicks at the powers that be.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 07:53:45', NULL, 28),
	(3, 'CentCom', 'Space: The Australicus Sector', '# The Australicus Sector\n> "Course, once you get past the spiders, and the weather, and all that stuff... yeah, it\'s a fair dinkum place, really."\nA sector in name only, the Australicus Sector is a subdivision of the Trailward Near Rim once used as a penal colony, and today known galaxywide for its hostile conditions, dangerous wildlife, and friendly populace.\n\nIn terms of habitability, the Australicus sector is considered a minor miracle, with 18 fully habitable planets spread across its stars. Such unprecedented density of habitability, however, comes at a cost- the planets are home to an incredible array of flora and fauna, most of which wants you dead. While the Australican spiders are the most famous inhabitants, special mention also must be given to such species as the Kinross Redhead Snake, the River Snapper, and especially to the Drop Bear.\n\nConstituting a federation of 9 stars (Kookaburra, Booderee, Adelaide, Elizabeth, King\'s Star, New Pembroke, Kinross, Topside and Zealandia), alongside a number of outlying territories, the Australicus sector has its own legislature, which represent it as a federal entity at the TerraGov Senate.\n\n### Kookaburra\nThe capital system of the Australicus Sector, Kookaburra is considered to be the least hostile of the systems of the Australicus Sector. It is, naturally, host to the capital planet of the sector, Union, alongside 2 other habitable planets, all of which have mild climates and generally harmless fauna.\n\n### Booderee\nBarely qualifying as a star system, Booderee consists of its central star, with one singular planet in orbit- Crestpoint. Despite this, it\'s relatively densely populated, having a higher population than larger systems such as Topside and Kinross.\n\n### New Pembroke\nThe site of the first settlement within the Australicus Sector, New Pembroke today has the honour of being the most populous of the Australican star systems, with its four habitable planets being home to around a fifth of the Sector\'s overall population between them. The capital, Arthurstown, sits on the golden shores of Albion\'s largest sea, and is a popular tourist destination within the sector.\n\n### Topside\nThe most sparsely populated of the stars of the federation, Topside\'s three planets are each essentially uninhabitable by normal means. The most hospitable, Earlmont, beats the other two by actually having a breathable atmosphere- however, the baking heat of Topside scorching its sands makes the surface practically unlivable. Instead, the inhabitants of Earlmont dig into the ground to construct settlements, such as the planet\'s (and system\'s) capital, Copperhead.\n\n### Zealandia\nZealandia is the proverbial black sheep of the Australicus Federation. Culturally distinct and relatively independent, the Zealanders can only barely be considered Australican. Similarly to Kookaburra, the climate and fauna of the various habitable planets are mild and generally safe, and Zealandia has therefore taken the title of the Australican breadbasket for its agricultural output.\n\nThe capital of the Zealandia system is Lancaster, located on the planet Waterloo.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:02:57', NULL, 28),
	(4, 'CentCom', 'Space: The Core Territories', '## TerraGov Core Territories\nThe Core Territories are those systems closest to Sol, split between the inner and outer core. This region is well patrolled and generally safe, with a number of important systems scattered throughout.\n\nOfficially, the core starts at the borders of the Sol System, and ends at the start of the Close Rim. Alpha Centauri is the closest Core Territory system to Sol.\n\n### Adasta: The Second World of the Empire\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Adasta has rapidly become the largest industrial centre in Alpha Centauri, making it one of the most industrialised planets in human space. Though it does not currently rival the Moon or Saturn (although it is close), its current trajectory of expansion suggests that in less than a century it will surpass them.\n* This industrialisation is prompted by an incredible mineral wealth. Ore deposits lie near or at the surface, with massive excavations and open pits pulling up billions of U¢ worth of ore daily. Unfortunately, however, the planet lacks plasma, which makes its ability to keep up with technological advancements limited without imports from Mars, or further afield.\n* The shipyards of Adasta are colossal, and the TerraGov navy has plans to set up facilities for the production of the next-generation of capital vessels there- much to the chagrin of the corporations operating on and around the Moon, who are presently responsible for the expansion of the TerraGov navy.\n* Adasta has a yearly "dark season", wherein the cloud cover becomes so thick and severe that the sun is essentially blocked out for several months at a time. This is known as the Long Night to the inhabitants of Adasta, and it\'s when Adasta City truly comes alive.\n\nAdasta was one of the greatest finds during Humanity\'s surveying of the Alpha Centauri system. An Earth-like planet, Adasta was perfect for human colonisation, with passive fauna and edible flora, and a quite survivable, if cold and significantly wet, climate. These conditions have precipitated an explosion of activity, bringing millions of settlers in the centuries since humans first set foot on its surface. Now, it\'s the main population centre of Alpha Centauri, as well as one of the most populated planets in human space, with well over 8 billion people calling it home.\n\nAdasta, as is perhaps expected for a planet of its importance, is well represented in the senate- in fact, it is overrepresented relative to its population. This is perceived by many to be a deliberate choice to avoid a repeat of the disastrous Martian revolution, particularly as Adasta is now critical to maintaining humanity\'s industrial and military sectors.\n\nAs far as life on Adasta is concerned, the planet is considered by many to be "Earth, but darker and rainier". Modern industrial techniques and technology allow the planet\'s industry to run cleanly, giving a remarkably low pollution relative to its industrial capacity. While the planet may lack some of the old-world charm of Earth, it more than makes up for it with its modern city design. They say that Adasta City has humanity\'s best nightlife, as well as some of the best quality of life anywhere in human space. The constant battering rain is a mere inconvenience when every street has a cover.\n\nThe twin moons of Adasta, Romulus and Remus, have become true industrial heartlands in much the same way as Earth\'s own moon, with major shipyards and manufacturing facilities.\n\n### Astarte: A Home in the Clouds\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Astarte is another of Alpha Centauri\'s densely populated planets- a fact that might be surprising given it\'s a Gas Giant.\n* The planet is named for Astarte, the Caananite and Phoenician Goddess of war, romance, and power. This name was picked due to the planet\'s pinkish hue at sunsets, first observed during initial exploration efforts of Alpha Centauri.\n* The upper atmosphere on Astarte is surprisingly breathable, having an atmospheric composition only slightly different to that of Earth. This allows the planet\'s gas cities to remain open air.\n* For a gas giant, Astarte offers a surprising array of biodiversity, with flying animals "swimming" through the upper atmosphere.\n\nAstarte began its life under human influence in much the same way Saturn did- being targeted for potential gas extraction. However, fate would carry the planet in a different direction, as details of its atmospheric composition were discovered. With a composition similar to that of Earth, the planet was functionally useless for large scale skimming, but a different opportunity presented itself- atmospheric shipyards. Offering crews the comfort to work on large ships without requiring EVA gear, the planet became popular for this purpose, with the technology of gas cities being pioneered here. As time went on, the inherent beauty of the planet started to draw another, different, clientele- the rich. Astarte is now one of the most expensive places to live in human space, particularly around its capital of Ishtar, which has gained a reputation to rival Paris as "the city of love". Ludicrously expensive sky-manors and apartment blocks now make up a large portion of the gas-cities of Astarte.\n\nThe gas cities of Astarte are sprawling structures made up of a number of colossal interconnected platforms, held at a steady height by atmospheric thrusters. The number of platforms per city varies- Ishtar, the largest, is made up of over 200. Transport between platforms is usually accomplished via flying vessels, though often grounded rail links also offer connections.\n\n### Harvest: Humankind\'s Breadbasket\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* The capital city of Harvest is Carter\'s Prospect, which is also the largest city on the planet, boasting a population of 750,000. The city is particularly green, with numerous parks and open spaces, and very little of the city has buildings above a few storeys.\n* The planet as a whole has a population of 6 million, spread across the extremely fertile central band. Fewer live in the vast forests of the north and south.\n* Harvest is an Agriworld, with an economy very strongly based upon farming. Food from Harvest feeds humanity throughout the galaxy, with millions of tonnes being produced per annum. Other economic sectors include mining, logging and tourism.\n* The several moons of Harvest are barren, and as such are unpopulated.\n* Owing to its history as a settlement of Biosustain, the Harvester dialect that has emerged there is regarded as a German regional dialect, although with significant alteration due to additional migration through the centuries since.\n\nHarvest, in the Demeter system, is one of Humanity\'s more important colonies, due to the incredible fertility of the soil there. Classified as an Eden planet, Harvest has a perfect atmosphere for humanity, as well as a remarkably mild climate. By all accounts, it was a perfect planet for humankind to settle, and humans have taken excellently to life there. The population is austere, hard-working and communal, and the people pride themselves on this fact, viewing offworlders with a degree of suspicion. Rural areas are dominated by colossal farms, producing huge quantities of food crops, as well as large amounts of animal products. In urban areas, food processing plants are common, turning the harvest from the countryside into high quality products to be shipped across the galaxy.\n\n### The Locker: Throw Away the Key\n> "Welcome to your new life, inmates."\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* If you\'ve found your way to the Locker, you\'ve fucked up somewhere along the line.\n* A home for the worst the galaxy has to offer, the Locker is where those deemed too dangerous to be held in any standard prison are sent.\n* Perhaps the most famous inhabitant of the Locker, Sterling Q. Atamann, the former Archmagister of the Wizard\'s Federation, is kept in a special "null-cell" within the highest security portion of the prison.\n\nLocated in a remote system somewhere on the fringes of the TerraGov core, the Locker (as it is colloquially known) is humanity\'s highest security prison, for humanity\'s worst criminals. Built into an asteroid within a nebula and guarded by a detachment of the TerraGov navy, the prison houses a diverse range of evil types: mass murderers, war criminals, the criminally insane; they all find their way to the Locker. Once you\'re there, you\'re not leaving. In over 150 years of operation, nobody has (officially) successfully escaped the Locker- though many have tried.\n\nCommissioned in 2405 as a replacement for the previous Jump Three Incarceration Facility, the Locker is divided into 3 categories: Supermax, Hypermax, and Psych-Detention. Given the Locker is only used for criminals who are serving a life sentence *and* are so dangerous to society that they must be entirely separated from it, these distinctions are more geared towards liberties granted to the prisoners: visitation rights, luxuries, etc.\n\n### Idyllus: Paradise by the Sunset Lights\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Located in the trinary Marinus System, Idyllus is an ocean resort world famed the galaxy over. Its pale sands, shallow and warm azure oceans, lush jungles and mangrove swamps, tropical climate, and peaceful fauna make it an ideal location for vacationing- and for the massive resorts that have sprung up to accommodate those visitors.\n* The oceans on Idyllus really are shallow. At their deepest, they bottom out at around 50 feet deep, and the average depth is closer to 25 feet. The seabeds are alive with coral and plant life, with abundant fish in the crystal-clear waters above.\n* As most of the surface of Idyllus is covered with water, floating platforms and submerged structures are used to expand beyond the small islands. Popular amongst humanity\'s richest are submanors beneath Idyllus\' azure waves. Those with less money (though still enough to spend on holiday homes on a resort world) may opt for a floating home, either in isolation or as part of a settlement. The very richest have private islands.\n* The signature animal of Idyllus is the Idyllic Seaskater, a massive ray-like creature that is found throughout its oceans. Notably sensitive to water conditions, attempts to keep it in captivity in aquariums away from Idyllus have lead to little besides dead seaskaters and disappointed marine biologists.\n* A holiday for two to the KP Marine Hotel and Resort is one of the top prizes available via the NT Corporate Perks system.\n* The trinary nature of the Marinus System makes for some wonderful sunsets on Idyllus, bathing the planet in three different colours at once.\n\nThe jewel of the Marinus System, Idyllus is an ocean world with what can only be described as the *perfect* conditions for vacationing. Between its climate, views, ecological features, and ease of access, Idyllus attracts billions of holidayers per year to its pale sands. Additionally, it\'s become a very popular location for second homes, with many of mankind\'s richest and most elite buying up property on its surface, from seahomes to submanors, and even private islands.\n\nThe largest settlement on Idyllus is Scheria, named for Homer\'s utopia. Boasting a population of 8 million, Scheria is famed as one of the most expensive places in human space. Many fashion houses and luxury dealers have branches there, as well as a number of the galaxy\'s top chefs having restaurants amongst its streets. For the less rich, cities such as Thebes or Menelaus might be more accessible, offering an urban experience similar to those found in island nations of the 21st century, and with a more down-to-earth permanent population as well.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:05:41', NULL, 28),
	(5, 'CentCom', 'Space: The Sol System', '## Sol System\nAh, Sol. The centre of human space, and the ancestral homeland of every human throughout the galaxy today. As is probably expected from the centre of a galactic empire, the Sol System is densely populated (mostly in the central band), heavily industrialised, and full of opportunity. In addition, it\'s easily the safest human territory one could choose to live in, as any attackers (or pirates) will rapidly find themselves under the guns of half the TerraGov fleet stationed above the Moon.\n\n### Luna: The Lunar Free Territory\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* As one of humanity\'s first settlements, Luna was originally settled prior to the foundation of TerraGov, instead being handled entirely by corporate entities from various nations on Earth. This created some friction at the outset of TerraGov\'s existence, which (after some debate) lead to the establishment of the Lunar Free Territory- the territory was incorporated into TerraGov\'s jurisdiction, but with significant economic freedom when compared with other federal regions. This loosening of red tape has allowed the Moon to flourish into an industrial heartland for humanity, with colossal shipyards and massive manufacturing plants.\n* Part of the agreement in founding the LFT was in allowing some legal autonomy to the governing corporations. Major laws passed down by TerraGov are still enforced on the planet, but most of the day-to-day legal system is handled instead under the jurisdiction of the Free Territory Committee, a board made up from representatives of the 12 Lunar corporations (and a 13th vote given to TerraGov to prevent deadlock, ostensibly due to their "continued cooperation in the success of the Lunar Free Territory"), and by the megacorps who run each region themselves.\n* As might be expected, the voting on the FTC can turn violent if it goes against some corporations interests- however, care is taken by all parties to minimise the collateral and keep their conflict on the down low, such that they can avoid attracting the wandering gaze of the slumbering giant of TerraGov.\n* The largest of the Moon\'s cities is Capra City, operated by the Italian fuel giant APdS S.p.A. and originally founded as a centre for helium harvesting and processing. While not the official capital, it is the first city that most people think of when picturing the Moon, and it pioneered the stack city concept that the rest of the Moon\'s urban centres would copy.\n\nThe Moon: ever a focus of Humanity\'s gaze. A muse for artists and romantics; an object of study and lofty goal for science, the first step into the final frontier. With all this in mind, it is perhaps no surprise that the Moon was one of the earliest bodies beyond Earth to be colonised as part of the Sol Rush. So early, in fact, that it was done prior to the "unification" of Earth under TerraGov. A number of independent moon colonies were founded during this period, under a total of 12 different corporations from various nations. Thanks to their efforts, Luna was heavily industrialised, taking advantage of the thin atmosphere, low gravity, and large swathes of virgin land to build massive shipyards and factories.\n\nWhen TerraGov did come into being, however, this created a problem. The nominally-independent Moon had relied for centuries on its status as an economic and industrial free zone, but humanity\'s centralised government claimed natural dominion over the Lunar body. This dispute escalated through the senate\'s halls, and then into the legal system, until the work of Chancellor Christian Ebert (and the resulting Lunar Free Zone Act) brought about the establishment of the Lunar Free Territory- an economic free area, under nominal TerraGov jurisdiction but with significant economic, industrial and legal liberties afforded to a newly-founded committee of the 12 ruling corporations. This deal allowed the Moon to remain an important hub for industry, while also giving TerraGov the ability to maintain important legal stability and territorial integrity in the Sol System.\n\nLife on the Moon today is characterised by stratification. The dominant form of Lunar architecture, and the perfect example of this phenomenon, is the stack city- so named as it is tunneled into the surface, with wealthier citizens living on or near the surface underneath great domes, while beneath lie the poorer districts where the workers live.\n\n### Mars: Fuelling Humanity\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* The capital city of Mars is New Osaka, in the Arabia Sector. Originally founded as Oda Colony, the city has expanded to have a population of 10 million and hosts most of the planet\'s administrative and governmental functions. It is also known as the Red City, due to its red rock buildings constructed from local materials... and due to the frequent sandstorms that roll through its streets. It\'s not uncommon for entire weeks to be characterised by dust hanging heavy in the air.\n* The planet has a population of 850 million, spread mostly across the northern hemisphere where the flatter land permits more extensive construction.\n* Much of the planet\'s wealth comes from its plasma mines (of which 65% are in the Amenthes sector), although other minerals are also in relative abundance. Other major sectors include manufacturing, spacecraft construction, chemical production, and financial services. Tourism, funnily enough, does not rank amongst the top sectors, quite possibly because nobody wants to stare at endless dust.\n* Mars is the subject of ongoing terraforming attempts: a stable atmosphere has been introduced alongside enough vegetative life to sustain it, as well as a substantial amount of water, but much of the planet is still arid, useless dust. Future efforts are intended to focus on increasing soil fertility and planting a number of forests which are intended to act as the planet\'s lungs, similarly to the Amazon on Earth.\n* The planet\'s moons, Phobos and Deimos, are home only to small research outposts and mining operations, and host a population of around 1000 between them.\n\nAs the closest planet to Earth, Mars has always captured Humanity\'s interest as a potential future expansion route off of our home planet. And in the late 21st Century, this goal would first be realised, with the foundation of a series of small scientific outposts. It would not be until the mid-22nd Century that the true value of Mars would be realised with the discovery of plasma in the Amenthes sector. Acting as the key to FTL flight and being used in more and more manufacturing processes, the mining operations on the planet would expand rapidly, and this necessarily drew more settlers to work the mines. Soon, a network of new, organised colonies would be set up by the companies with stakes in the mining operation.\n\nAlongside the foundation of these colonies, a major terraforming campaign was started with the aim of making the planet liveable, and this would proceed throughout the following centuries, with water being sourced from Neptune to create artificial water bodies, and large artificial atmospherics machines being constructed to provide a thick enough atmosphere to allow for plant life to survive. This atmosphere would become self-sufficient in the course of around a century, allowing the people of Mars to discard their helmets and bulky space suits while living on the planet- and further facilitating expansion of the colonies there.\n\nNow, Mars stands as a symbol of Humanity\'s ability to overcome harsh conditions, even if the planet is not Humanity\'s largest nor most prosperous colony.\n\n### Venus: Living on Hell\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Colonisation of Venus has been amongst Humanity\'s greatest challenges. Terraforming seems impossible: the solution instead has been to construct domed colonies for housing workers, maintained by a complex system of shielding and corrosion resistant coatings.\n* Living on the surface of Venus is generally not something done for long periods of time: workers are generally rotated in and out on a fixed schedule while working for the mining corporations, although how long those rotations are varies.\n* Sulfur is the lifeblood of the planet\'s economy. Nearly everyone who lives and works on Venus is involved in sulfur extraction, of which two main forms exist: mining for solid elemental sulfur and metal sulfides, and extraction of liquid sulfuric acid via drilling and fracking. The remainder are scientific expeditions and researchers.\n* The planet boasts an overall population, between the surface and orbital platforms, of around 20,000.\n\nSulfur. Ever an important chemical in industrial processes throughout history, this yellow element took on a new lease of life with the discovery of plasma. A new industrial process for the harvesting of plasma from amenthite, and other associated low purity ores, taken from Mars\' vast plasma mines was developed, known as the Altmeyer process. A key reagent of the Altmeyer process is sulfuric acid, used to create a slurry which is then subjected to further purification- and this demanded high quantities of sulfur. With extraction on Earth essentially drying up as the supplies of oil did, the chemical corporations of the Sol System turned elsewhere: to the surface of Venus.\n\nVenus was well explored by humanity prior to its colonisation, but never had any landings of this scale been undertaken. Beforehand, the peak surface population at any point was 15 people, living on a single Terragov-funded research outpost. After the first landings by Exagon Extractions, the population jumped to 1,200. And more companies followed, as time went on: including a few big names: Cybersun Industries maintains a large share of sulfur mining on the planet, as does Nanotrasen- and the two are presently posturing to take over the smaller corporations to secure a larger piece of the pie.\n\n### Saturn: Feeding Chemistry and Fusion Power\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Gas Skimmers dot the upper atmosphere of Saturn, harvesting the valuable gases it contains. These Skimmers are maintained in a tight orbit, acting similarly to gliders, and contain machinery which collects, traps, cools and compresses, and finally stores the harvested gases.\n* The vast majority of the population on Saturn is (perhaps obviously) on orbital platforms: the Gas Skimmers maintain a skeleton crew who are tasked with keeping the machinery in working order and doing tasks that are unsuited to robots. The life of a Gasjack, as they are called, is rough and unpleasant, as they live and work in tight confines aboard the Gas Skimmers, and to venture outside they must wear pressure suits that are even more cumbersome than spacesuits. Their pay is excellent, however- which may ease the stress somewhat.\n* Orbital shipyards and industrial stations make up a vast network above Saturn, utilising resources harvested from the planet and its moons.\n* Much of the initial prospecting and early Gas Skimming of Saturn was handled by Havelka Gas Enterprises, a Czech gas extraction concern who designed and perfected the initial Gas Skimmer designs. The company would eventually be snapped up by Cybersun Industries, as part of their growing industrial empire in the Sol System- but not before the designs for the skimmers were copied by numerous other corporations.\n\nAs one of the Sol system\'s primary sources of hydrogen and helium, Saturn is today considered critical to industrial manufacturing of sublight fuel, as well as providing fusionable material for large-scale power generation. In order to harvest these important gases, the atmosphere of Saturn must be tapped- and to accomplish this, the Gas Skimmer was born. A small, lightly manned vessel, gas skimmers maintain a tight orbit within the upper limits of the planet\'s atmosphere in order to capture and store gases which are then sent to orbital stations for separation, purification, and eventual sale/further manufacturing. The scale of this operation cannot be understated: to fuel humanity\'s advance to the stars, thousands of skimmers must be active at any given time. When one eventually outlives its usefulness, it is evacuated and allowed to drop into the crushing depths of Saturn\'s deep atmosphere, never to be seen again.\n\nThe overall population on Saturn is estimated in the 10,000 range- of which around 3-4,000 are Gasjacks aboard the skimmers, and a further 7,000 sit in orbit.\n\n### Titan: Methane Seas\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Titan is of particular interest to humanity as a source of organic chemical material- useful building blocks for things like plastics, pharmaceuticals, food additives, and really anything that\'s important in the modern day. Given the depletion of oil reserves on Earth, the chemicals produced on Titan are critical for maintaining humanity\'s manufacturing capabilities.\n* The atmosphere of Titan is thick with methane, and is therefore toxic to human life. Colonies on the surface are domed and gastight.\n* Titan, as a moon of Saturn, also takes advantage of the planet\'s orbital network of manufacturing plants and shipyards.\n* Titan has spawned its own megacorporation, the Canada-based Howard Organics. They control a commanding share of operations on the moon, which has made them wealthy enough to compete with the big boys.\n\nAs any organic chemist will tell you, organic chemistry is key to the modern world. Almost every product that is available in modern society has, at some point, been passed through the hands of an organic chemist, be that for the production of plastics, or formation of medicinal products, or any number of critical steps in producing useful things. To that end, supplies of useful organic material are critical to humanity. As it presently is, our main source is oil, which will not last forever.\n\nIn the 2200s, following attempts at conservation throughout the 21st and 22nd centuries, humanity\'s worst fear was realised, as the oil reserves on the planet finally dried up. A scramble to find a new source of organic material was initiated, as the planet began rationing remaining supplies and instituting extensive recycling programs. A brief dark age would emerge for the following few decades, known today to historians as the Transitory Period. Fortunately, salvation would be at hand in the form of Titan- the moon had long been known for its methane reserves, but with little reason to exploit them there had been little more than minor expeditions and small scale operations on the planet. This would change with the arrival of Trent Howard, a Canadian industrialist and organic chemist, who had discovered a new method of methane extraction, purification, and functionalisation, on the scene. Howard\'s process would revolutionise methane extraction on Titan, and almost single-handedly end the Transitory Period, as well as earn Howard his place in the sun with his new company, Howard Organics.\n\nNow, Titan is inhabited by an estimated 8,000 people, spread across hundreds of extraction plants on the planet\'s surface- most of which are owned by Howard Organics.\n\n### Jump Zero: A Long Way From Home\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Jump Zero was, until the first trip to Alpha Centauri, the furthest humans had ever managed to travel, being weeks from Earth. Now, it\'s less than a half hour\'s FTL cruise from Earth. How far we\'ve come.\n* These days, it\'s pretty much an unimportant backwater, maintaining relevance only as a military installation and for minor historical tourism.\n* Last chance for gas: next service 4.367 LY.\n\nJump Zero, or to use its "official" title, Padmanabhan Station, was the historical furthest frontier of human expansion until the advent of "just-sublight" engines that made the trip to Alpha Centauri possible. Placed in orbit around Eris, the station marked an important milestone at the time, being around 3 weeks from Earth with the sublight tech available at the time. The United Nations Joint Military Command (of the time) spearheaded the creation of the station as a joint project with the Society for the Advancement of Science and Technology (SAST) to serve as both a scientific research outpost for nearby celestial bodies and a military outpost to serve as an effective testing ground for new warship technologies and as a deep-space training site.\n\nMany important technologies were pioneered at the Padmanabhan Proving Grounds, including the subspace broadcaster (finally giving Jump Zero a direct line to Earth), several new developments in ship design, and most importantly, humanity\'s first viable "just-sublight" engine. This final discovery would take most of the purpose out of Jump Zero\'s existence, shortening the time needed to reach it to about 13 and a half hours, and allowing humanity to branch out beyond Sol to Alpha Centauri.\n\nThese days, Jump Zero\'s scientific purposes are all but depleted, as is much of its tactical reasoning to exist. It is maintained by the TerraGov navy as a secondary basing point, and as a deep-space zero-G training site for marines, mostly for sentimental purposes.\n\nOf course, there\'s more behind the scenes, specifically on Eris...\n\n### Eris: Away From Prying Eyes\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Taking advantage of the military presence permitted by Jump Zero, TerraGov made the entirety of Eris a restricted area, only for the use of the military. This has resulted in a lot of military infrastructure being set up across the planet- training grounds, production facilities (for approved corporations only), proving grounds, and monitoring equipment.\n* Eris is also home to the elusive "Sector Zero"- a not-so-secret top secret TerraGov facility under some of the tightest restrictions in human space. Nobody\'s quite sure what goes on there except the highest echelons of TerraGov, and they\'re not keen to share.\n* In terms of civilian population, Eris has a small number of settlements that are pretty much entirely for people working at the military institutions, be those soldiers or civilian staff. These are also under restriction, with visitors requiring extensive permits to even set foot on the planet. This understandably makes Eris quite an isolating post for a soldier.\n\nUnder Jump Zero is the dwarf planet, Eris. This unassuming rock took on remarkable potential after the construction of the station above, giving TerraGov extensive land far from prying eyes to adapt to new purposes, and so they would set about turning Eris into an extensive military complex, originally designed to complement Jump Zero\'s facilities, and then eventually to replace most of them as Jump Zero became more and more obsolete. TerraGov now handles a range of specialised trainings on Eris\' surface, including low-atmos warfare, low-gravity warfare, and helljumper certification, amongst many others.\n\nNo shadowy military installation is complete without secrets, either, and Eris has many, mostly within the boundaries of "Sector Zero": a deeply classified military R&D facility located at Eris\' equator under heavy guard, 24/7. This has become one of mankind\'s worst kept secrets, as everyone knows exactly where Sector Zero is- not that it helps them with getting in.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:08:12', NULL, 28),
	(6, 'CentCom', 'Space: The Spinward Far Rim', '## Spinward Far Rim\nThe Spinward Far Rim is the furthest region of human-inhabited spinward space, taken up by three main sectors: the Spinward Sector (which is detailed in its own document), the Frontier Sector, and the Imperial March Sector. Of these, the first two are in direct human control, making up the extents of humanity\'s spinward expansion and giving way to lizard space. The third, the Imperial March, is a special case, however. The systems making up this sector are, under the terms of the Treaty of Atrakor, considered a demilitarised zone under the control of humanity. Neither human nor lizard military vessels are permitted access to this region, and this has created an issue of enforcement in the area for laws. As such, crime has been allowed to ferment here, with pirates picking at the valuable trade links between Humanity and Lizardkind. Talks to reopen the area to anti-piracy enforcement have been slow, with the lizards being hesitant to allow human vessels access to the vital region for fear of creating a springboard for a future invasion.\n\n## The Imperial March\nThe Imperial March is the catchall term for the demilitarised zone comprising portions of the Spinward Far Rim and the Tiziran-owned Frontier March Sector. No military vessels of either side are permitted in the region, which has made this area a major hub for piracy and crime, plaguing merchant ships using the Kalon run to travel between human and lizard space- although there are no safer alternatives that would remain profitable.\n\n### Val Corrin: Libertalia of the Starry Skies\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Val Corrin has no official capital. The largest settlement is Tabletop, located on top of the Great Green Table, a vast tepui close to the coast. Described as a new Tortuga, Tabletop is a small yet bustling city that\'s as full of (illicit) opportunity as it is rife with danger.\n* Val Corrin is outwith of any official government\'s space. No gods, no masters. Well, except the Black Flag Council: the closest thing the planet has to a central authority, made up of representatives of several pirate organisations operating in the area. While their power is limited in preventative policing, they *are* quite capable of punishing rule-breaks after the fact. Mostly via violence. In fact, exclusively via violence.\n* The native population of the planet, the Etarin, keep to themselves. Very occasionally one will wander to an offworlder settlement to trade for supplies, adorned with a concealing cloak. Nobody knows what they look like beneath the cloth.\n\nAlso known as the Smuggler\'s Moon, Val Corrin lies in the Exodus System: at the meeting point of TerraGov and Tiziran space, and simultaneously in neither. Its lush jungles, wide crystal clear oceans, impressive tepuis and cenotes, and pure white beaches are reminiscent of the islands of the Caribbean- under better circumstances, it may find itself as a resort world. However, it has attracted a different clientele, with less-than-ideal intents.\n\nAs a haven for criminals of all creeds and colours, Val Corrin is maintained as a neutral territory by its Articles of Agreement: a list of rules enforced by the Black Flag Council, who also act as an intermediary for government on the planet. Of course, governing those who do not wish to be governed is a difficult task, and the planet remains dangerous for those unable or unwilling to get their hands dirty in defending themselves. Should you find yourself on the Smuggler\'s Moon, keep a weapon close at hand, and never let your guard fully down.\n\nIf you\'re willing to put up with that, you can find almost anything on Val Corrin. Its position at the crossroads of empires gives it many routes to products, from illicit drugs, to more mundane items being sold without tariffs. The stock available is variable, and highly dependant on who you know; the black market consortiums won\'t sell their best to just anyone, so it helps to have a reputation amongst the criminal elements of the galaxy.\n\nOutwith the hustle and bustle of the spacefaring settlements live the elusive Etarin, native to the jungles of the moon. Rarely seen by outsiders, their society remains unknown to the Empires that surround them. Even those living on the planet know little about their neighbours. When one does contact the outside world to trade for supplies, they hide their tall form beneath a heavy cloak, and do not speak- instead pointing to what they want to barter for. Their enigmatic nature has made them the subject of fierce curiosity, but as of yet, none have peered beneath the cloak to see the Etarin as they truly are.\n\n### Ancienne: Remnants of a Lost Civilisation\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Ancienne has no official capital, with only small scattered outposts across the planet\'s surface. The closest the planet would have is Chronos Orbital, an orbital platform servicing the aforementioned outposts and acting as more permanent housing for workers coming to and from the planet. The overall "permanent" population of researchers and explorers across the entire planet is around 10,000, though there may be thousands more "wildcat" operations which are undocumented.\n* Ancienne is believed to be a major colony of an ancient empire, with around 85% of the planet\'s surface covered in ruined cities. Such an ecumenopolis is surely filled with incredible discoveries- if they can only be found. The outposts across the planet act as research bases and salvage hubs, bringing in items of interest and finding out what they are and how they work.\n* Some plans exist to resettle the planet, but they\'re not particularly far into the process and none have yet garnered attention from TerraGov.\n\nHumanity is far from the first civilisation to make it to space, and it is not going to be the last. Remnants of ancient civilisations dot the galaxy, occasionally being unearthed during groundwork on new colonies or by intrepid explorers. However, no find as of yet has been able to compete with Ancienne, in the Saramix system. An ancient ecumenopolis which has been tied to the long-extinct Terintan people, cities comprise about 85% of the planet\'s surface, with the rest consisting of salt deserts which are believed to have once been oceans. Damage to the planet\'s ecosystem are irreversible without extensive terraforming- the likes of which are presently being tried on Mars. That said, despite the lack of surface water and failing atmosphere, the planet is also a hotbed of activity due to the incredible finds hidden within its labyrinthine concrete jungle. Terintan technology was far ahead of our own, and as such almost everything that can be salvaged in sufficiently working condition to be studied is worth an incredible amount. This has attracted the brave, intrigued, and desperate to try to hash out a living exploring the perilous ruins and bringing back salvage.\n\n### The TMV Providence and Tortuga Station: The Lost Cruiser\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* The TMV Providence was one of the first wave of FTL-equipped large cruisers in the human arsenal. In the 2400s, the aging vessel was sent on an anti-piracy mission in the Spinward Sector to maintain supply lines during the Human-Lizard wars, from which it would never return.\n* The story of the capture of the Providence is a legendary story amongst the Spinward Sector\'s pirates. If the tales are to be believed, the vessel was taken by a small crew against incredible odds- though in the process, it ran into a large asteroid, which it is still embedded in to this day. Tortuga Station was then built around the ship, using its reactor and engineering facilities.\n* Tortuga Station is, alongside Val Corrin, considered one of the great bastions of piracy along the Kalon Run, taking advantage of the demilitarised zone to raid trading vessels travelling between human and lizard space. It\'s gained a hell of a reputation in the past 50 years.\n* Tortuga owes much of its relative peace to the work of the Red Sun and his gang, the Solars. They form the defacto authority on the station, maintaining peace with an iron fist and requiring a cut from any independent pirates seeking to use Tortuga\'s services.\n\n### New Jalisco: Frontier Life\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* New Jalisco was originally pioneered by a small Mexican resource extraction firm, since acquired by Nanotrasen and rolled into NTHI. As such, much of the population of the world originates from Mexico and other Latin American nations, and Spanish is widely spoken alongside Galactic Common there.\n* The planet has only one permanent settlement, Vallarta, built up around and supporting the planet\'s spaceport. Other settlements are mostly temporary, springing up around pockets of resources and being packed up and moved when the veins run dry, leaving only automated infrastructure behind. To accommodate this purpose, much of the construction on the planet is done with modular prefabricated structures, which can be lifted in and away by air when required.\n* New Jalisco is primarily a mining colony, with rich deposits of precious metals and iron, as well as a significant production of minor metals. Due to the planet\'s low population, very little refinement occurs on New Jalisco itself, with ore instead being shipped back to the galactic core for processing at larger industrial worlds.\n* Life on New Jalisco is best described as "frontier living". The desert climate, general isolation, and hostile fauna all adds up to give an experience that\'s quite similar to the old stories of the wild west- although today the outlaws pack bigger guns, and the only horses are made out of steel.\n* The planet has one orbital station, Veracruz Orbital, mostly utilised for the loading and unloading of massive cargo vessels that are too large to reach the planet\'s surface.\n\nPioneered about 100 years ago by a now defunct Mexican company, New Jalisco is today another cog in NTHI\'s extraction machine, providing ores and minerals to keep humanity\'s industries running. Despite its importance for resources, however, the planet is of little interest to most travellers, with its wide, dusty red sands, mesas and canyons being visually striking but isolated and underdeveloped.\n\nNew Jalisco has a small population, with most permanent residents being clustered around its capital, Vallarta, which is also the planet\'s only permanent settlement. It\'s a relatively busy port, all things considered, mostly because New Jalisco is a major producer of useful minerals, and they need shipped back to the core for refinement. Outside of Vallarta, most of the planet\'s population are temporary workers, brought in on rotation to man the mines (which are mostly automated), manage logistics, and generally keep the operations on New Jalisco ticking over and ore flowing offworld. Life this far into the frontier is austere and lonely, with luxuries being few and far between, and strong isolation from the galactic core.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:18:42', NULL, 28),
	(7, 'CentCom', 'Space: The Spinward Sector', '## Spinward Sector\nThe Spinward Sector has become somewhat of an important region for humanity in recent years. With the frontier having moved along past it towards the Imperial March, increased attention from both TerraGov and corporations, and the collapse of the Third Soviet Union, some modicum of stability has finally began to settle in around New Moscow. Most of the populated territory in this region is under the control of the Spinward Stellar Coalition, a nominally independent state which is getting attention from TerraGov in what appears to be a movement to bring the region into full integration- although this is obviously being resisted by the SSC.\n\nNote that stability does not mean that the Spinward Sector is a safe, centralised area like the Core. Danger still permeates the region, with the limited oversight the SSC and TerraGov can provide being mostly focused on the main population centres. Piracy and violence are still commonplace, and away from the prying eyes of the regional governments, corporate powers vie for power against one another- with the ultimate prize being the freedom to operate in the area, and claim its mostly untapped mineral wealth for themselves.\n\n### New Moscow: (Former) Home of Space Communism\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* The capital city of New Moscow is (the aptly named) New Moscow City. With a population of 12 million, New Moscow City is the most populous city not only of New Moscow, but of the entire SSC (of which it is the capital), and is famous for its brutalist architecture and generally oppressive urban style (though this has somewhat softened since the collapse of the Third Soviet Union). Since the collapse, the city\'s culture has flourished, and a remarkable amount of modern art and architecture has since blessed its streets. On Workers\' Square there is a popular public theatre collective which does showings, and in general the city has become a major destination for artists.\n* New Moscow is also the closest major human colony to Nanotrasen\'s spinward stations, and as such is a major destination for Nanotrasen workers. In addition, it serves as the major transport hub for the region, with major spaceports and shipyards ready to service travellers to the SSC.\n* The planet has an earth-like climate, though is generally colder than the mother planet. The overall population is around 250 million.\n* The primary exports from the planet are minerals, chemicals and agricultural goods, with manufacturing and tourism being other major sectors.\n* As is to be expected of the former capital of the Third Soviet Union, Novayarossiyan is the official language of the planet- Galactic Common is generally spoken and understood in the major population centres, but those with no knowledge of Novayarossiyan will struggle as they venture further into the countryside.\n* Space has now been corrupted by capitalism. All is lost.\n\nNew Moscow has had a tumultous past. Originally founded by and serving as the capital of the Third Soviet Union, the planet first came into humanity\'s grasp under less than ideal circumstances. Atrocities by the leaders of the TSU alongside political repression, famine, and a generally poor standard of living would come to a head in the August Revolution, seeing the fall of the Soviet leadership on the planet, and beginning the final collapse of the Third Soviet Union. Following this violence and the subsequent rise of the Spinward Stellar Coalition, the planet would go on to experience a renaissance, as the industrial capacity grew and culture flourished. Today, New Moscow is a shining example of excellence in humanity\'s border regions, and its meteoric rise seems set to continue.\n\n### Gateway: Welcome to Terran Territory, Tiziran Friends\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* The Gateway system holds the dubious honour of being the furthest incorporated Terran territory from Earth in the Spinward direction. It is therefore the first stop for new arrivals to human space from the Tiziran Empire, provided they\'re following legal channels to do so.\n* This important position makes the Gateway system a major hub, despite its location. It boasts the largest TerraGov citizenship of any territory within the Spinward Sector by several orders of magnitude, although it still pales massively in comparison to anywhere within the core.\n* The main population centre in Gateway is Port Ellis, on the planet Amundsen. A cold, harsh world, Amundsen is still easily the most habitable of any body within the system. Additionally, Freeport Habitat, located in its orbit, is a major shipping destination, holding the honour of being the largest station outside of the core, with extensive shipyards, fuelling facilities, warehouses and cargo handling, an extensive commercial section for travellers, and the first checkpoint for documents within Terran jurisdiction, provided you\'re entering from the Spinward side.\n* Gateway is also the last major anchorage prior to the Imperial March for TerraGov military vessels, under the terms of the Treaty of Atrakor. From here, Terran vessels are able to patrol the Spinward Sector, although at a reduced capacity- they cannot enter into the Imperial March, however, without breaching the treaty and risking a diplomatic incident with the Tiziran Empire.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:21:06', NULL, 28),
	(8, 'CentCom', 'Space: The Frontier March Sector', '# Frontier March Sector\nThe furthest sector from Tizira in Lizard space, the Frontier March sector is a world of extremes. Despite roughly half of its area being demilitarised, the remaining portion is some of the most densely fortified land under the Tiziran banner, ever vigilant for the chance of another war with humanity breaking out. For much the same reasons, the region is also simultaneously one of the best patrolled and safest, and most rife with piracy and danger.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:25:14', NULL, 28),
	(9, 'CentCom', 'Space: The Rizkalon System', '## Rizkalon System\nAlmighty Rizaklon, the Sun-Queen, lifegiver and mother to all. The Rizkalon system is similar to Sol in many ways, acting as the centre of the vast lizard empire, as well as being the most densely populated and industrialised system under lizardkind\'s umbrella. It\'s also the safest region of lizard space due to the presence of the Imperial Navy.\n\nInterestingly, Rizkalon also shows relatively extensive precursor activity in the further reaches, dated millenia back.\n\n### Sulya: Lizardkind\'s First Colony\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Classified as a Snow World, Sulya is in the grips of a significant ice age. Forests dominate the central habitable band of the planet, with significant geothermal activity under the surface. Volcanoes are common, as are hot springs, and much of the population of the planet is clustered around these regions of warmth.\n* Sulya\'s capital is Serebin, founded as part of the initial wave of colonisation of the planet. The city has a population of around 15 million.\n* Sulya is home to one of the "Natural Wonders of the Tiziran Empire", Lake Urayah- fed into by a number of smaller hot spring tributaries, the entire miles-wide lake is naturally heated to a pleasant temperature. The lake is additionally located at the foot of the Great Smoking Pillar, Sulya\'s largest active volcano, which has been in a constant state of mild eruption for 300 years. The shores of Lake Urayah are home to a number of resorts and tourist attractions, and the volcano itself has attracted some religious significance amongst the Tiziran pantheon as "a symbol of Merina\'s gifts".\n* Lizards seeking to venture beyond the heated areas close to the hot springs need to account for their body\'s lack of natural heating, a problem which has been overcome by use of heated jumpsuits, utilising electrical heating to keep the body warm. In settlements, heated water from the springs (or from geothermal wells) is piped under streets to maintain the temperature, as well as distributing hot water to the population for heating their homes.\n\nThe closest planet to Tizira, Sulya was Lizardkind\'s first colony- over 700 years ago, the first colonists landed on Sulya to set up a new life there. In the 7 centuries since, Sulya has, despite being in many ways inhospitable to lizard life, grown to become a key part of the Lizard Empire, and to encompass a population of around 500 million. Life on its snowy surface is idyllic in many ways, with excellent sights, natural hot springs to relax in, and pleasantly snowy weather. As a result, it has become a popular tourist destination, with ski resorts, spas and health retreats being particularly popular establishments.\n\nIn the Tiziran pantheon, Sulya is one of Tizira\'s sisters, hailed as the Goddess of Hearth, Home, the Harvest, Cooking and, somewhat oddly, Athletes and Competition. The reason for this connection seems to have been lost to time, but it is still observed: the annual Imperial Games on Tizira is still dedicated in spirit to Sulya, although this is only lip service due to the secularisation of the state.\n\n### Merina: The Salt, the Sand, and the Baking, Baking Sun\n\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Merina is a sun-scorched wasteland. No life remains on its dried-up exterior, and no observable hydrosphere remains on its surface. In addition, its atmosphere is thin.\n* Research suggests that at one point, Merina was similar in climate to Tizira, but that some calamity in the distant past resulted in the planet\'s magnetosphere becoming too weak to sustain a proper atmosphere. For a long time it has been referred to as "the Lost Child of the Sun-Queen", and is traditionally part of the Tiziran pantheon as being the stillborn twin of Tizira herself.\n* Merina has substantial mineral wealth, which is mostly funneled into the industries around Atrakor.\n\nAs another planet close to Tizira, Merina has long fascinated lizardkind. However, once the space-age came, and lizardkind was finally able to see her surface in person, it became clear that Merina did not have the fortune that Tizira did. The sun-scorched dunes, salt flats, and cracked-mud wastelands that comprise the surface tell the tale of a dead planet, and archaeological and environmental assays show that Merina did, at one point, sustain simple life. And yet, disaster had clearly struck the planet, weakening its magnetosphere and allowing it to fall to the baking heat of Rizkalon. The planet does, however, still bear significant material wealth, which has led it to become a major target of industrial expansion under the Imperial regime. Metals and gases from Merina today provide a significant portion of the Rizkalon system\'s industrial capacity.\n\nAs the dead sister of Tizira, it is perhaps fitting that Merina is regarded as the Goddess of Time and Death in the Tiziran pantheon- oddly fitting, even, given that the Tizirans did not truly behold the devastation on Merina\'s surface before declaring her a Goddess. Note that the domain of Death does not extend to being the God of the Dead- that honour falls to Atrakor, as the protector of lost souls.\n\n### Viomea: Scorched Remnants of an Empire Lost to Time\n* Viomea is located on a similar orbital trajectory to Merina. The two pass alarmingly close to each other at times.\n* Widespread settlement of Viomea is impossible, despite the inherent value of the planet, as the environment is just too inhospitable to sustain long-term life.\n\nViomea is the third planet from Rizkalon, and is close enough in orbital patterns to be seen as a sister to Merina. Like her sister, she is extremely inhospitable, though for different reasons. The atmosphere on Viomea has an alarming quantity of chlorine, leading to an extremely acidic environment. The surface of Viomea is defined by four main characteristics:\n\n* Extremely acidic water, including open bodies, rivers, and rain.\n* Extreme temperatures, as high as 70 degrees celsius in some areas.\n* Constant poor weather, including extreme storms and winds, frequent hurricanes, and near constant tornadoes (which freqeuently become "acidspouts" due to meeting open bodies of water).\n* A dense, hardy jungle of silicon-based plants, which manage to survive their hostile environment.\n\nUnderstandably, this would normally turn off would be settlers and adventurers, but Viomea has opportunity lurking behind the danger: the planet was, at some point in its history, used as a ship graveyard by a (presumably extinct) species. These precursor vessels represent an extremely lucrative source of wealth from Viomea\'s surface- if they can be reached. As such, brave (or foolhardy) lizards make a living making excursions to salvage what they can from these ancient hulks, selling the salvage on for research. The Tiziran government sponsors such expeditions via a state-owned corporation, known as the Viomea Salvage Corporation.\n\nViomea is another key part of the Tiziran pantheon, taking the position of the God of War, Soldiers and Victory. The Imperial flagship has also taken this name due to the obvious connection.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:26:23', NULL, 28),

Nar\'Sie\'s followers, on the other hand, have a far simpler and less developed canon for how the universe began, owing to the much more brutish and bloodthirsty followers She leads. Ichorstorians (academic experts on the Cult of Nar\'Sie), have pinpointed one particular story of the universe\'s origin that became highly popular among blood cultists, though it appears that the story\'s popularity has less to do with the symbolism or veracity of the tale, and more to do with how angry it gets Ratvarian followers to hear. The tale goes roughly as such:\n\n*"Roughly 600 years ago, Nar\'Sie was born into a void! Then, shortly after, the far less interesting and elegant God of Machinery, Ratvar, was born. In this void, there was little for the two gods to do to pass the time. Ratvar began drawing up plans celestial plans for amazingly complex and breathtaking machinery, while Nar\'Sie relaxed and contemplated Their existence. One fine day, while Ratvar was playing with His pipes, Nar\'Sie accidentally bumped into Him and knocked Him over. This confused the two of Them greatly, as They had not even been aware of the concepts of something being able to be knocked over! So began the Age of Violence, as Nar\'Sie laid the foundations for wrestling and martial arts by developing and practicing new moves, grabs, strikes, pins, holds, and more by bullying Ratvar endlessly.*\n	\n*"One day (or night, whatever), Ratvar was feeling extra queasy from the endless beatdown His older sister had wrought on him. What happened next, and the precise moves that Nar\'Sie performed on Him, have been lost to time and frequently lead to violent arguments and brawls among Nar\'Sie\'s followers (like most things). The only thing they can all agree on is that it was a move that would become known as the "Puke Driver", a special modification of the Pile Driver that Nar\'Sian cultists have tried to recreate for centuries to no avail. Upon being Puke Driven, Ratvar immediately began violently wretching and spitting up cosmos and elements across the universe, in an event that is popularly known as the "Big Blech" among Nar\'Sian scholars."*\n\n\n\nThe tale is laughable and blatantly inconsistent with most of recorded history, though this fact fails to concern the Nar\'Sians who swear by it. In the end, to them, as long as it makes Ratvarian followers upset upon hearing it, it will continue to be passed down among their disciples.\n\n\n## Nanotrasen Department of Opposition\n\nSometimes, an attack on an NT station or convoy seems just a little *too* perfectly planned and executed. While no one can deny that sometimes the Syndicate gets lucky and a plan of theirs succeeds with only minor turbulence, sometimes the intel that the insurgents seemingly had access to seems a bit *too* secret or *too* timely for them to have realistically used in a plan, or their assault teams are a little *too* familiar with the habits and protocols of NT Asset Protection teams. During situations like these, there is often an uneasy tension in the air among the investigators that, while small leaks and individual defectors to the Syndicate indeed occur, some examples of treachery seem far too organized and close to home for comfort. It\'s almost as if there\'s some sort of larger conspiracy at play, deep within the central nervous system that is NT\'s core structure.\n\n\nRumors abound of an old department that used to run security tests on Nanotrasen\'s Spinward Stations in order to ensure that high security assets and personnel would be protected in the event of corporate sabotage, the Department of Opposition. There\'s nothing on the official records to confirm such a department exists or ever existed in the past, but a black ops department that\'s hidden from casual observers would be just the kind of thing Nanotrasen would have squirreled away in such a remote and distant corner of space. The real concern would be, who would be there to ensure that the DoO\'s tactics and protocols were ethically handled, or even aligned with the greater good of NT? It\'s perfectly possible that the department, if it ever existed or continues to exist, may have been compromised long ago and now actively works to dismantle the rest of Nanotrasen\'s Spinward assets.\n\n\nOf course, for most of NT\'s employees, there\'s no real way of knowing for sure whether such agents and operatives are actually out there staging false flag attacks on Nanotrasen\'s assets, or what their possible motivations could be. But, still, sometimes an assassination or an act of sabotage seems a little *too* perfectly carried out. Pass by the bar or canteen once the news has disseminated among the crew, and you\'ll likely hear at least one reference to the DoO among the nervous whispers of the crewmembers.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:32:06', NULL, 28),

Will he not suddenly be aware of his precarious situation, trapped in a tiny metal box, floating through the incomprehensible nothingness of space?"  \n> -Dr. Heinz Haber, German physicist and science writer\n***\n\nContents\n1. Space Madness\n2. Beyond the veil\n3. Prominent entities\n4. Amusing Factoids\n\n## Space Madness\nThe trials and tribulations that one must endure during their career working in space are surely damaging to one\'s mindstate. Nanotrasen\'s stations are no exception. Through the tedium of work, the inhumane living conditions, and the bloodshed. An individual will develop some cracks in their psyche. And sometimes, though these cracks, something terrifying will slip in.\n\n***\n## Beyond the veil\nThese horrors are not from here. Not birthed from any planet or star but rather another plane of existence. Some scientists believe that these beings\' home is connected to bluespace technology, due to its frequent utilization and the rise of cults to these horrors beginning occurring at around the same time. Others say that this other place is less tangible and more of a manifestation of human consciousness, ideals, and fears. There has also been speculation that this other plane (or planes) are linked to the magic of the Wizards Federation and other practitioners.\n\nThese horrors are shown to have increased influence in certain areas where the veil between worlds is weakest. These tend to be in areas where fear, paranoia, and bloodshed are prevalent. Madness overtakes weakminded individuals turning them into deranged cultists of whatever horror influenced them, or driving them to suicide. Multiple distinct documented entities have proved their influence over the years.\n***\n# Prominent entities\nThis section will be documenting most of the known entities that have had an influence on unfortunate souls and the cults that derived from them.\n\n\n## Nar-sie\n#### AKA the Geometer\n\nNar-sie is by far one of, if not the most prominent of these horrors. She is often referred to as female by her cultist although these beings from beyond the veil undoubtedly don\'t conform with the human concept of genders. This is probably because she inspires some sort of twisted maternal vibe in her followers. She seems to be an embodiment of blood, pain, and self-sacrifice. Her cultist also references a "divine pattern" or "hidden shapes." Her cultists are considered threats to the corporation and have always had a single hostile intent - To bring Nar-Sie herself from beyond the veil.\n\n### Gifts of the Geometer\n\nCultists of Nar-Sie usually can fashion eldritch runes out of their blood. They also are shown to have the ability to infuse themself with eldritch power allowing them to incapaitate foes by tempoaraly cutting of circulation to his or her\'s brain and create items such as daggers and shackles out of nothing. Most dangerously, powerful Nar-Sians can bombard an incapacitated victim with psychic pain while linking them directly to Nar-Sie effectively creating a new cultist. This process however is quite intensive and usually requires multiple cultists to do it correctly.\n\n### Cults of the Geometer\n\nThere is no single large cult of Nar-Sie. This is due primarily to their recklessness and eagerness to perform their dark matron\'s work. As soon as a group of cultists reaches the point of confidence in which they could succeed in their unholy mission, or even just be a boon to their cause, they will attempt it. Most of these attempts will fail and end in the destruction of the cult. But as a cult is crushed, elsewhere one will surely arise. Rarely, mentaly reclusive cultists will develop a glimpse of sanity and act more like heralds and scholars than suicidal zealots. Many consider Nar-Sie as a guiding figure or a sorce of knowledge. These heralds are usually found to be a disgrace to the Geometer in the eyes of other cultists. This is because of the lack of ambition to complete their one goal. Heralds are still considered enemies of the corporation and are to be neutralized.\n***\n\n## Ratvar\n#### The Imprisoned God\n\nRatvar was once a powerful entity competing with the likes of Nar-Sie. It resided on a plane known as "Reebee" or the "City of cogs." Supposedly, it was a clockwork city made of brass in which its cultists could enter once they had realized its power. However, this plane was also Ratvar\'s prison from which it yearned to escape. While Reebee is gone, it is assumed that other structures such as temples or engines of the cult\'s creation still exist although it is unknown if they still have the power once bestowed to them by Ratvar.\n\n### The Cult of Ratvar\n\nIt is assumed that all of Ratvar\'s cultists died with Reeee. The Cult of Ratvar was once a congregation of followers who managed to transcend to Reebe. They prepared for a ritual where they would fire up the engines of Reebe in a spot where the veil is weakest and free their god from its prison.\n\n### The Fall of Reebe\n\nThe fall of Reebe was an event in which Reebe, Ratvar, and all of its cultists were struck down by Nanotrasen. The cult was preparing Reebe for the freeing of Ratvar where the Veil was weak. Outpost 17, a small nanotrasen asteroid mining station was the target. Brave crewmembers managed to slip through the cracks in the veil and into the heart of Reebe with a bluespace artillery beacon in tow. With a desperate plea being sent out to a nearby security outpost, Reebe was obliterated along with the crewmembers of Outpost 17.\n***\n\n## Lesser entities\n\nThese entities are documented and may hold some power but are considered lesser threats due to unwillingness or inability to interact with mortals.\n\n### Eldrich Gods\nVery little is known about the so-called Eldritch Gods or "Epochs". Certain practitioners of magic are said to use their power to fuel deranged rituals usually involving human sacrifice. It is to be noted that these practitioners don\'t serve these gods but rather wrangle the indifferent Epoch\'s power through rituals.\n\n### Infernal Beings\nCertain entities that have been identified as demons or devils have been seen on stations. It is unknown if these beings are connected to the likes of other beings beyond the veil or something else entirely. The sighting of such beings seems to line up more with the rise of the Wizard Federation than the invention of bluespace technology suggest a correlation.\n\n### Yalp Elor\nA collection of individuals calling themself the cult of Yalp Elor seemed to have supernatural divination powers. These cultists had grown in numbers for a few decades. The group was eventually discovered in a warehouse drenched in their blood with most of them dead after an anonymous tip. The living cultists were detained by SSC Military units. Most were executed at the pressuring of Nanotrasen. Interrogation has revealed that these cultists are aware of reserve a deep hatred of Nar-Sie and her cultists. The remaining few members of the cult are being held in Spinward superjails indefinity.\n***\n\n## Amusing factoids\n* Some say they saw Ratvar\'s body falling from the sky when Reebe was destroyed\n* Nanotrasen legally owns all of its employee\'s souls\n* Failure to confess to practicing unapproved religions will be met by being held under a large rock until the time of confession', 'Religion', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:36:20', NULL, 28),

Rifts formed in the armed forces, too, and these tensions would brew to a head as the central government collapsed. The pro-red side would ultimately find themselves on the losing side, and this would force them to make a choice. Many crews stood down, accepting an offer of clemency from the newly-founded SSC. Many others simply vanished, with the ships being scuttled and left to rot in deep space as their crewmembers made new lives elsewhere. But a few decided to continue the fight. Amongst these numbers was the flagship of the Union, the PWS Khranitel Revolyutsii (Guardian of the Revolution), a grand and modern warship (for the time) crewed with over 500 diehard loyalists to the Soviet State.\n\nAnd so, the Khranitel Revolyutsii would go on to become a figure of legend. As of yet, it has not revealed itself in the Spinward Sector, despite extensive efforts to locate it by the SSC. How exactly a ship of 500 managed to slip into the void so effectively is a subject of fierce debate, and it\'s made the ship take on a mythical quality. Some say the vessel will reappear when the fires of communism most need relit. Some say the crew are kept alive by the strength of their conviction and loyalty. Some say that the vessel is simply lost, and that somewhere out there, the wreck of the Third Soviet Union\'s flagship is there for the taking.\n\nAll that can be said for certain is that it\'s not shown its face yet.', 'Non-Fiction', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:38:44', NULL, 28),
	(14, 'CentCom', 'Species: Slimes and the Blob', '## Slimes\n\nThroughout mankind\'s time in the stars, they have encountered many diverse and interesting species. From other galactic faring civilizations, to incredible fauna, the universe is filled with many fantastic new varieties of alien life. And then, there are slimes.\n\nSlimes are the omnipresent pest of the galaxy- an invasive species that nobody is really certain of the origins of, but that has quickly become one of the most annoyingly common problems for nearly everyone living throughout human space. Capable of extremely rapid breeding, living off of anything with lifeforce (which means that they can derive nourishment from almost anything) and with an insatiable hunger that drives them to damage livestock, agriculture, and in extreme situations, attack humans. They frequently find their way onto ships, which spreads them further.\n\nIn terms of physiology, slimes consist of a jelly-like substance coalesced around a central "core". This core houses nearly all of the slime\'s important functions, acting as a nerve centre. Slimes exhibit very low levels of intelligence, blorbling and bubbling in response to auditory stimulation. Some say that they may be attempting to communicate when doing this, but scientists have dismissed these claims.\n\nSlimes also exhibit varying colours, seemingly with different characteristics. These colour mutations are based on the environment the slime finds itself in- however, in captivity, slimes exhibit seemingly random mutations, with no particular regard for their surroundings. Scientists have found no explanation for this phenomenon as of yet (which seems to be a running theme with slimes in general).\n\nDue to their extreme abundance, many scientists have tried to find a use for slimes, but seemingly to no avail. To this end, Nanotrasen has set up a new Xenobiology task force, with the intent to discover a use for these common pests. Many of Nanotrasen\'s top minds in this field suspect that the slime cores will be important to this eventual discovery.\n\n\n## The Blob\n\nSometimes, something within a slime goes wrong. Much like a cancer, cells begin to divide unchecked, and the slime takes on a new, more unwholesome form. The common term for this phenomenon is Blobbing, and the organism that it creates is known, colloquially, as a blob. Blobs replicate endlessly, regardless of energy input, consuming anything in their path.

	(15, 'CentCom', 'Species: The Ethereals', '# The Ethereals\n\n> "Stellar Shock: a term attributed to the societal and political upheaval caused by undergoing 1500 years worth of technological development in less than 50."  \n> -On the Difficulties of Enlightenment and the Ethereal People, Dr F. Jimenez\n\n## Description:\n\nThe Ethereals are a humanoid species hailing from the planet of Sprout- a densely jungle-covered planet with wide oceans and plentiful rivers. Near the oceans there are thick saltwater bogs, while inland rocky plateaus and tepuis, lush cenotes and occasional volcanoes dot the landscape. The skies have a constant cloud cover, and monsoons are frequent across almost the entire planet\'s surface. However, it is not the landscape itself that makes Sprout a planet of ecological interest, but the flora and fauna. Almost every living thing on Sprout thrives off of electricity. Via a complex ecosystem of beings that provide electricity via electrophoresis and electrochemistry, and those that consume electricity as their main source of energy. Amongst these "electrical consumers", Ethereals are the top of the food chain.\n\nEthereals themselves are a biological oddity, with an internal organ structure and life cycle that puzzles even the most decorated xenobiologists. Their skin is translucent, revealing both their blood- a complex, bioluminescent solution similar to battery compositions known colloquially as Liquid Electricity- and their internal organs, which are crystalline in structure. How exactly these crystals function is unknown. Analysis of the chemical makeup of Ethereals reveal that they are not carbon-based, but silicon-based, which has lead some to theorise that the internal working of an Ethereal is much like a flesh-and-blood machine.\n\nWhen first discovered by TerraGov\'s explorers, the Ethereals were in a Medieval age, similar to our own Middle Ages- a brutal era of warfare and decentralised rule, with quasi-feudal nobility ruling over petty fiefdoms. TerraGov initially made the decision to observe the populace of the planet- however, an event would occur that would force them into contact with the natives: the Day of Fire. A TerraGov resupply vessel would suffer a malfunction in its thrusters while coming to dock at the observation post, resulting in them becoming jammed on. This pushed it (and the observation post) into the gravity well of Sprout itself, resulting in the entirety of the station crashing down nearby to a city on the surface. Survivors who were fortunate enough to jettison would now find themselves stranded on the planet, which had, until moments beforehand, been entirely unaware of the existance of aliens. The resulting fire from the crash burned around 20,000 square kilometers of jungle (an area roughly equivalent to modern-day El Salvador) before a monsoon was able to extinguish it, and this left TerraGov with a crisis to resolve. This resulted in the decision to uplift the people of Sprout, in what became known as the Great Enlightenment. Until this point, direct intervention with "primitives" was strictly forbidden by TerraGov.\n\nThe uplifting was not gentle, nor was it well received (at first). The Ethereals were ripped from their feudal institutions into the plasma age in less than 50 years. The decision sent waves across humanity, and the galactic scene- diplomatic protests from the Lizards (who viewed the act as an aggressive expansion by humanity into another species\' territory) and the Moths (who viewed the act as an immoral interference with the natural development of another species) would create problems for the project, but once it was started, it was irreversible.\n\nAnd so, the Ethereals would find themselves thrust onto the galactic stage.\n\n### Fun Factoids:\n* Sprout has three moons, of which one is able to maintain a breathable atmosphere, as well as a tropical climate. This moon, called Spring by the Ethereals, is now a resort world, with thousands journeying to it yearly to vacation.\n* Sprout is located in a particularly isolated region of space, with the most direct route to Human space being via a nebula- too dangerous for most vessels. For this reason, the planet takes a long time to reach from the rest of inhabited space, and particular commitment is needed to visit.\n* TerraGov advises remaining in and around major settlements while visiting Sprout, as the local flora and fauna are considered quite dangerous. Even in the larger cities, the possibility of a wild Volthound running rampant through the streets is (unfortunately) high. A secondary (and unspoken) reason for remaining in large settlements is the inherent risk of being kidnapped (or worse!) by reactionary militias.\n* If you\'ve been a member of the TGMC in the past 50 years, particularly as a peacekeeper, you\'ve might well have been deployed to Sprout to assist in the pacification efforts.\n\n### Sprout: From the Ashes\nSprout would undergo radical changes alongside the Ethereals during the Great Enlightenment. Major scale land recovery was undertaken, and the feudal society of old was replaced with an interim government set up by TerraGov to handle planetary administration until such a time as the Ethereals were capable of taking over for themselves. Power was seized from the autocrats and monarchs of old in doing so.\n\nFor the new planetary administration, a new city was needed, and this would be built in the remnants of the jungle that had burned during the Day of Fire. Vast towers of steel and concrete, alien to the Ethereals, would make up this new, concrete jungle, and the necessary infrastructure for a spacefaring civilisation was first laid here, including Sprout\'s first spaceport, intersystem communication relay, and TerraGov military installation at Fort Summer. Several TGMC divisions were stationed here during the Enlightenment and were critical in the pacification of Sprout.\n\nWhile the planetary capital has brought Sprout to the space age, the planet still has many remote and inhospitable regions which have not yet been connected. It is estimated around 65% of the Ethereal homeworld is still covered in jungle that is impassable to most vehicles, leaving settlements that are almost impossible to reach by land. As air facilities are also lacking, these remote settlements are mostly cut off from TerraGov\'s influence, and are generally reachable only via small, dangerous roads, or by foot through the dense jungle.\n\n### Ethereal Culture\nEthereal culture is particularly odd within the inhabited galaxy- while they had, prior to the Great Enlightenment, a very diverse range of homegrown cultural groups and individual societies, much of their history post-uplifting has been dominated by humanity, and as such, their cultural makeup has become homogenised and subsumed by humanity\'s. While they may not literally wear humanity\'s blue jeans and listen to their pop music, the influence of their "protectors" can be seen everywhere in modern Ethereal society. Native languages are dwindling, being replaced by Galactic Common. Traditional religion strains against the influence of human faiths. Long-held traditions are consigned to history. Efforts are being made by some to preserve the Ethereals\' distinct history, but it seems in many ways to be a losing battle, as more and more Ethereals make the decision to leave behind their life on Sprout and head out into the great beyond in search of adventure.\n\nSome of these attempts to preserve culture have come in the form of reactionary militias, made up (mostly) of the former warrior and priestly castes of Ethereal society. Wielding strong power and influence in the remote, cut-off hinterlands, these groups provide strong resistance to TerraGov\'s presence on the planet. While not strong enough nor bold enough to attempt attacks on the regions directly under TerraGov\'s influence, they are a perpetual threat in the border regions and cause serious problems for construction crews and frontiersmen in these areas. The task of expanding the frontier on Sprout is typically given to corporations via E-Colony charters. Nanotrasen is one of the many corporations involved in this process.\n\nNone of this is to say that Ethereals do not have a distinct culture. While the influence of humanity is extreme, they have maintained some elements of their heritage. In particular, Ethereal music remains a defiant area of their culture, particularly as music has major religious and cultural significance to the Ethereals.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),

Call Carlton and Barczak!"  \n> -Advertisement for litigation against Nanotrasen, following the Cloning Incident of 2560.\n\n## Felinids- the great genetic controversy of the ages\n\nAs Humanity\'s knowledge of genetics and the code behind it expanded, gene clinics became a common sight across Earth, offering miraculous solutions to previously debilitating illnesses. Everything from cancer, to Parkinsons, to prion diseases, became a concern of the past. And soon, bespoke genetic treatment for cosmetic purposes became commonplace, too. Humans became the masters of their own bodies, able to change their appearances to fit their whims, and so, inevitably, came treatments that were broader in scope.\n\nOne of these many available treatments was Animalisation- utilising specific aspects of animal DNA, humans could be altered to have desired traits from them. Despite their availability, animalisation treatments were (and are) viewed as a step too far, as they go beyond simple alteration of the human genome and into the realms of adulterating it with foreign DNA. Mutants of these types came to be viewed as no longer human, both by the public consciousness and by laws, and those receiving the treatments were shunned, leading them to coalesce into insular communities, and (many) to leave life in the Home Sector for the colonies.\n\nAnd so, Felinids would remain a curiosity, an uncommon sight in human space but not unheard of, until a scandal would rock the species as a whole: the Cloning Incident of 2560.\n\n## 2560\n\nNot long ago, Nanotrasen scientists discovered the secret of cheating death. Cloning technology was one of the many great scientific advancements of the 26th century, allowing those rich (or lucky) enough to have access to it to be returned to life in the event of their untimely demise. The technology was, understandably, heralded as a miracle for modern medicine, but beneath the surface lurked a dangerous secret.\n\nIt was known during development that the genetic code that is used by cloning to reconstruct the body was exceptionally fragile, and even the smallest impurities in the reagents used for the process could result in genetic deformities. Usually, these deformities manifested as small, undetectable issues- a little change here, a loss of function there, perhaps a "healthy" dose of cancer. These could be corrected by genetic treatment, so were not particularly concerning. But what could happen if there was a large scale contamination? Scientists had been limited in their capacity for experimentation in this field by regulations against human experimentation, but it was theorised that it would cause massive, irreversible damage to their genes, beyond even the reach of humanity\'s sophisticated genetic science. Unfortunately, this theory would finally be proven accurate on Monday, the 14th of January, 2560.\n\nEleanor Normandy, the chief chemical engineer at the Nanotrasen-Pauling Chemical Plant on Prosperity, was finally putting into action a plan which had been years in the making. At the reactor being used to produce Hyperclone Reagent A, a genetic soup that was used as a key genetic additive for cloning, she stopped, withdrew samples for sending to QA, and then produced a small tank, which she discreetly poured into the mix. Within the tank was several litres of Interdyne Pharmaceutics\' KitX Serum- a new genetic mutation serum designed to induce the Felinid mutation in a safer, more rapid, and more predictable form. And so, an entire batch of Hyperclone Reagent A was contaminated, and nobody would be the wiser. This plant serviced every Nanotrasen cloning clinic within the Home sector, as well as several Spinward Stations which were experimenting with new cloning techniques, and over the next few weeks, they would each receive their new shipments.\n\nAnd so, nothing seemed to be wrong, until the 28th of that month, 2 weeks after the incident.\n\nCustomers who had been cloned were found to be developing alarming side effects. There were the large and obvious ones, of course. The ears. The tails. Fixations on bright lights. But also a number of more subtle changes were observed too- altered mental states, changed tastes, new personalities. They were exhibiting all the signs of felinisation- but that was impossible, surely? Ordinarily this required months of intensive genetic therapy, and cloning was unlikely to produce such specific results over such a wide range.\n\nOf course, this prompted a massive outcry by the public, as this was far too large scale to cover up. Nanotrasen\'s immediate response was to close all cloning clinics immediately, and begin an investigation as to what went wrong. Before long, the contamination was found in samples of HRA, and the sudden disappearance of Ms. Normandy was noted. She was apprehended by Terragov police at a spaceport while attempting to board a flight to Harvest- presumably to lay low. However, during questioning, she suddenly died- having had a remote implant in her brain detonated by her unknown employer. And so, with no effective scapegoat, Nanotrasen was forced to bear the brunt of the incident.\n\nKnowing that the public would never regain trust in the process following an incident of this scale, Nanotrasen officially permanently closed all cloning facilities on the 4th of February, 2560, and cancelled all official research into the technology. Cloning would remain in use by the company afterwards, but only internally with exceptionally tight quality control.\n\n# Felinid Culture\nAnimalids are somewhat distinct amongst the "species" of the galaxy, due to not actually being a discrete species.\n\nCenturies of oppression and living apart from humanity has, however, caused a cultural rift with their parent species; while animalids are not entirely distinct, they have their own sets of cultural norms and tenets derived from those places where they came to rest. One example is the so-called "Nidochi" (twiceblood) population of Mars; having been tempered in the melting pot of Martian culture, they draw upon their East Asian and European lineages similarly to other Martians; but do so in a different way. One such way is in their cuisine, which has developed along divergent lines to the rest of Martian food, making stronger use of meats and "poverty ingredients" to create a distinct flavour that isn\'t seen across the rest of the red planet. Another is in art; a number of famous artists from Mars come from the Nidochi population, taking advantage of Mars\' less strict social separation to reach a wider audience than they might manage on other worlds.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(17, 'CentCom', 'Culture: Miscellaneous Culture of the Lizards', '# Miscellaneous Culture of the Lizards\n\n### Peliskpalo: The Tiziran Ball Game\nPeliskpalo (Game of War) is Tizira\'s "national" sport, played planetwide and popular amongst lizards of all colours, creeds and regions. Originally developed as a martial training exercise in the medieval period, the game would develop throughout the ages, with a standardised ruleset coming into play, alongside tournaments, and leagues. The first professional league was founded in the midst of the Industrial Revolution in Oskmarzel, and from there the game would take the world by storm.\n\n#### Rules:\nPeliskpalo is a team ball game, played with 8 players per side. The rules are simple: get the ball to the opposing end of the court. The ball can be moved by the use of any body part, but it cannot be held in the hands, nor can it move backwards. Should the ball move backwards more than one progression line, possession is relinquished to the other team. Contact is allowed, although in professional settings it is kept moderated to a low level (similar to rugby).\n\nA regulation Peliskpalo court is approx 80 metres long and 40 metres wide, with progression lines placed every 5 metres. At either end is a score zone, into which the ball must pass to score a point. The ball is a solid cork ball coated in rubber, set at a regulation size of roughly 6 inches in diameter (roughly 19 inches in circumference). This produces a relatively heavy ball when compared to air-filled examples from Earth.\n\nPlayers wear only light protection, usually restricted to thin pads on sensitive areas.\n\n### The Tiziran Currency\nTo understand Tiziran currency, it is first important to understand lizard mathematics- owing to the lizard physiology of 4 fingers per hand, many number systems on Tizira throughout history were to a base 8, instead of humanity\'s 10. From this, a hexadecimal number system developed to base 16, and this is today used across the planet. Lizard currency, therefore, is also to a base 16. The Tiziran Rena, or Crown, is the only official legal currency on Tizira, although Universal Credits are also frequently accepted by larger companies and in major cities.\n\nA complex systems of coins dominates the Rena, with coins representing fractions of a full Rena. The smallest increment is the sekata (half kata), which is 1/32th of a pelata or 1/512th of a rena.

Rena notes exist to the base 16, in order of 8 rena, 16 rena, 32 rena, etc.\n\n### Cityraisers: Masters of Civil Engineering\nWhen discussing lizardkind\'s greatest feats, many scholars turn to Tiziran civil engineering. From centuries of early industrialisation and harsh conditions, the Tizirans have developed an extremely strong ability at construction and engineering. This can be seen while wandering the streets of almost any Tiziran city, with lavishly detailed buildings that make no compromises on beauty nor functionality; grand urban gardens and parks; impressive statuary that captures centuries of history in stone. Indeed, life in a Tiziran city is in many ways idyllic.\n\nThis collective experience started with the requirement to develop effective methods of water transport and distribution. Early Tiziran settlements were therefore characterised by strong centralisation and public works- qanats, canals, reservoirs and cisterns, and then the harnessing of the power of water via waterwheels to power the beginnings of industry. Much of these initial settlements have been lost to time and war as the centuries rolled by (although older regions still bear ruined aqueducts and other such telltale signs of history), but the experience in city planning that their use imparted can be seen even today.\n\nAs might be expected from a people that have mastered civil engineering, Tiziran cities are littered with great works. Examples include the Waterworks of Taraviero, which is Tizira\'s largest surviving (and indeed, functioning) series of civil waterworks spanning across much of the medieval city centre. Included are the Grand Stepwell, a massive water storage structure running down Taraviero\'s main thoroughfare, the Tiziran Gardens, a large water garden near the site of the city\'s old castle, and the colossal Aqueduct of Taraviero, running an impressive 27 miles from Lake Ara in the Adeni Mountains into the centre of Taraviero\'s old city. Also included are the network of cisterns and water fountains which kept the city\'s populace supplied throughout the centuries, although a number are today rendered nonfunctional due to damage to the pipe system- and none produce potable water due to lead contamination from the ancient pipes.\n\nTaraviero also has another important landmark- the Soda Gardens and Baths. The local geology of Taraviero has lead to a number of natural soda springs nearby- producing carbonated water, these springs became the centre of a spa and wellness retreat in the early modern era, the Aldar Sanitarium and Health Baths. The institute constructed an extensive series of gardens using the soda water for water features, as well as "regenerative baths" which attracted nobility from across Tizira to bathe in the enriching waters. Later, the potential of Taravieran water was realised for drinking, and it began to be bottled and sold in the industrial age. Today, the spa complex, gardens and bottling are handled by the Taraviero Soda Company, although concern for the spring has lead to most of the bottled water and soft drinks made here being instead produced artificially from still water harvested in the region.\n\nZagoskeld has its fair share of impressive structures too, as is to be expected of the planet\'s capital. The Imperial Palace is a good place to begin: the current palace dates back to the early modern era, when the King of the newly unified Oskmarzel sought to move his court closer to the city. The site selected is on a small islet just outside Zagoskeld\'s city limits between the Tiga and Oron rivers, atop an ancient volcanic plug, and the location of a previous castle which was heavily damaged in a recent war and left to fall to ruin. This gives the royal palace an imposing view across much of the flatter land around it, as well as natural defenses against attack from the sea- although it was never designed to be a fortified castle. Its construction unfortunately outlasted the king, leaving his daughter as the first monarch to live in its walls. Throughout the years, the palace was expanded, and the road leading to it became a part of Zagoskeld city, specifically becoming the diplomatic quarter. Soon afterwards, the parliament building of Oskmarzel was built nearby at the northern tip of the islet. When Tizira unified under the Ozkmarzelic banner, the palace passed into being the seat of Imperial power, and the Oskmarzelic parliament building became the seat of the first Tiziran senate. Since then, the senate has moved to a new, purpose built building across the Oron river, with the old building being split into the official residence of the Prime Minister and a senatorial annex for commissions and small debates.\n\nAnother major landmark in Zagoskeld is the Triumphal Arch. Standing at 70 metres tall and dominating Zagoskeld\'s central thoroughfare, the Avenue of the Victorious March (or the Long March, for short), the Triumphal Arch is a monument to Oskmarzel\'s triumphs during the Wars of Unification. In the years since, it\'s become more of a symbol of Tiziran unity, with military triumphs to celebrate major victories ending their route at the Arch and its surrounding Plaza of Triumph.\n\nAlso of note is the New Fortress, standing at the opposing end of the Long March. Originally constructed shortly after the Imperial Palace, the New Fortress was designed to be a military hub and defensive structure for the growing city of Zagoskeld, in contrast to the old fortress on the site of the palace. Throughout the centuries, it received a number of expansions to keep up with the evolution of warfare, eventually becoming outdated in the industrial period. After a period of neglect, it was taken under the custody of the Archivist Order, who restored it and converted it into a tourist destination and museum. The urban headquarters of the Tiziran military was constructed adjacent to the fortress as a symbolic link to the Ozkmarzelic military\'s past. Today, the fortress is a popular tourist destination, and is famously utilised every Unification Day for the ceremonial firing of 149 guns- one for each member state which gave up their independence for the Tiziran union. This is also the traditional beginning to a military triumph- but Tizira has not celebrated one of those in over a century.\n\nAdditionally on the Long March is the Rizkalon Park, located at roughly the midpoint. A large and beautiful park, it is well known for three key features- the Water Gardens, an extensive example of Tiziran mastery of hydrology; the Necropolis and the westernmost entrance to the Halls of Atrakor\'s Own, Tizira\'s largest burial catacombs; and the Statue of the Unnamed Soldier, a monument to the unidentified dead of Tizira\'s many, many wars.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(18, 'CentCom', 'Species: The Lizards', '# The Lizards\n\n### A Basic Rundown\nLizardpeople originally hail from Tizira, in the Rizkalon system, though throughout their four centuries in the stars prior to meeting humanity they have spread over several planets and systems. This outward expansion was hindered by a lack of plasma and bluespace resources in their local sector, stunting their technological advancement and therefore their development (and rollout) of effective FTL engines, with many vessels within the navy not having been fitted with them prior to First Contact. Their technological level remains below that of their human rivals, aggravated by a limited transfer of ideas between the two species.\n\nTizira is notably more arid than Earth, with small, shallow seas and less arable land. In addition, the planet has a diminished ozone layer, leading to higher-than-average levels of solar radiation reaching the planet\'s surface. As cold blooded creatures, the lizards thrive in this environment, with major cities being built close to the coastlines and smaller settlements spread across the wide drylands and deserts.\n\nLizard society emphasises strict militarism and a rigid caste system. The caste system limits social mobility, separating society into distinct bands- however, as with many things in lizard society, enlistment in the military can change this. The military is intertwined deeply into lizard culture- all must serve a tour of mandatory service in the army after coming of age, it is customary for every citizen to be armed (typically with a blade, but into the modern era firearms have become commonplace), and the sight of a soldier on every street corner is not only typical but expected. Advancing in the military heirarchy is one of the few ways a low caste lizard might hope to raise his social standing.\n\nAs one travels further from the core systems however this culture softens. A century and a half of contact with humanity and a limited projection of power from Tizira has made lizards on the frontier of the empire much more humanlike in their mannerisms. There are many lizards alive today who have never lived within the borders of the empire, and care little for its customs.\n\n### Fun Factoids:\n* The moon of Tizira was famously bombed by the TerraGov Expeditionary Corps during one of lizardkind\'s many conflicts with humanity, creating a noticable "scar" across the surface which can be seen from the planet. The Planet Cracker drink is named for this event.\n* The Imperial Lizard Army is famous for their melee skirmishers, who utilise throwing weapons and short-ranged firearms to great effect alongside razor-sharp blades. Despite their embarassing defeat by humanity, they\'re still well respected within lizard society.\n* The Draconic spoken by lizard crewmembers is a Spacer form of the language, created by decades of isolation from Tizira. Lizards from the core systems speak a distinct form of Draconic, known as "High Draconic" or "The Emperor\'s Draconic".\n* With the newfound (and uneasy) peace between humans and lizards, some degree of cooperation between the species has blossomed. Tizira lends an expeditionary force to the human-led Anti-Xenomorph Coalition. Much of this cooperation is pushed by the present ruler of Tizira: the young Empress Arael-Rena I, who has used her limited power to pursue a more pro-human foreign policy than her predecessors in bold opposition to the parliament- much to the chagrin of both the military old guard and a significant portion of her people.\n* Pronouncing X as "ecks" is badass.\n', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(19, 'CentCom', 'Sitalesse: The Worship of the Heavens', '# Sitalesse: The Worship of the Heavens\nThe largest religion on Tizira, Sitalesse (Draconic, Sky Worship) is a polytheistic faith revolving around the worship of celestial bodies, subdivided into a number of subfaiths that place importance on specific deities. Having originally been born of the regions surrounding the Minosk, the religion was carried further afield by Classical-age imperial conquests, and then further again by colonialism. At the religion\'s peak in the Industrial Age, around 50% of the population of Tizira followed some form of Sitalesse. By the time of the settlement of Sulya, this number had dropped to about 30-35%. Now, following centuries of space travel, the rise and fall of Lacertism, and a general shift from devout religious practice, the religion is followed by only around 25% of the planet\'s population, and less so in the colonies.\n\nThe principal subfaiths of Sitalesse are those that follow Atrakor, Tizira, Rizkalon, Sulya, Viomea and the Twin Moons Pelara and Iskil.\n\n### Atrakor: The Warrior and Guardian\nWithin the Sitalesse Pantheon, Atrakor, the Night Sky Lord, represents military might, chivalry, honour, duty, and acts as the guardian of the souls of the dead. This commanding position, particularly with the emphasis on militarism within Tiziran society, places the Moon Father and his cult as the primary deity of the Sitalesse pantheon in Tiziran culture, despite his position within the pantheon not being at its head.\n\nThe importance of Atrakor has resulted in moon iconography being common within Tiziran culture. The Empire\'s flag, as an example, displays Atrakor in full illumination, typically associated with military might. This same icon appears on the royal coat of arms, with Atrakor being considered the patron deity of the royal family. Other phases carry other meanings- Atrakor\'s New Moon, for example, is associated with the dead and revering their eternal souls, and is considered the Holy Day (or night, as the case may be) of the Moon God, being an important prayer day and marking the end of a Tiziran week. To this end, the emblem of the New Moon is often found on ossuaries, and adorning the walls of burial catacombs across the empire.\n\nTemples dedicated to Atrakor are common across the Empire, particularly around the Old World side of the Zagosk where Atrakor worship was most prevalent (and that would go on to be the heartland of the Tiziran Empire). Some of the most impressive include the Imperial House of the Moon in Zagoskeld and the extensive temple complex of the Halls of Atrakor in the foothills of the Adeni Mountains near Taraveiro.\n\n### Tizira: The Earth Mother\nTizira, the Earth Mother, is regarded as the spiritual creator of lizardkind, forming an integral part of the Sitalesse creation myth. She is said to have been created by Rizkalon and the unknown King of the Cosmos to serve as lizardkind\'s mother and home, serving her children through her bountious gifts. She subsequently went on to birth the first lizards, and then entered an eternal slumber, content knowing that she would provide for her children through the ages. This important role has made her a common icon of worship across the Old World, with temples to her glory being present in almost every major settlement, even if her cult is considered smaller than that of Atrakor\'s.\n\n### Sulya: The Mother of Hearth, Home, Harvest, Athletes and Competition\nOne of the lesser deities of the pantheon (but no less worshipped), Sulya holds domain over a wide variety of facets. Of these, she is most associated with hearth and home, being the goddess of domiciles, warmth, and family. This makes her an important icon for home shrines, maternity wards, nurseries, and other similar places. Additionally, her domain over the harvest makes her a key goddess in the rural regions of Tizira where farming is a key source of income- indeed, it is these areas that hold most of her primary temples and monasteries.\n\nShe also holds domain over a very different facet: competitions. Here, she serves as the patron goddess of athletes, for theological reasons lost to time. For this reason, her iconography of the White Coastflower and the Korta Nut is commonly used in sports, including being the symbol for the Sulyanic Games- a global event similar to the human Olympics.\n\n#### Fun Facts:\n* The most famous depiction of Sulya is in the painting "Sulya Anoints Her Champion", a piece depicting her pouring water over an armoured figure. The piece created controversy at the time of its creation due to its immodest depiction of the goddess, but has since become a landmark piece in Valyngian culture, representing a key step forward in the Valyngian renaissance.\n\n### Viomea: War, Victory, and Metal\nViomea\'s domain over war, victory and metal has netted her a prime pantheonic position amongst the war-hungry Tizirans. As the patron goddess of soldiers, her icon (the Bloodrose) is used commonly across the armed forces, often alongside Atrakor\'s full illumination.\n\n### Pelara and Iskil: The Trickster Twins\nThe cults of Pelara and Iskil are both quite small in comparison to the more major gods, mostly due to their limited and niche domains- Pelara is the Goddess of Peace and Diplomacy, and Iskil is the Goddess of Malevolence and Anger.\n\n# Sumalism: Secular Ideology of Supremacy\nFollowing Tiziran unification and the advent of their space empire, a new wave of thought began to sweep across the land, started by the political firebrand (and later Prime Minister) Ana-Sumal. Sumalism, as it became known, preached a secular doctrine- that there were no gods, nor any grand reason to be, besides those that the Tizirans made for themselves. That the purpose of the Tiziran people was to unite and to go forth, to manifest their destiny across the great beyond. This nationalistic belief structure became popular amongst the military and political thinkers of the day, and in particular was taken up strongly by Parliamentarians. In addition, it began to supplant traditional religious beliefs amongst the populace.\n\nAs Sumalism rose, it would become foundational to the politics of the early Tiziran empire, leading to a strong military buildup, the advent of widespread conscription and national service, the expansion of the military bureaucracy to other civic positions, and importantly, to a rapid and efficient expansion of the empire\'s borders. In essence, the state became subservient to the military. This came with a cost, however- the rapid expansion and jingoism would draw the attention of their galactic neighbours, and under the circumstances, war was inevitable sooner or later- and many were fought, both successful and inconclusive, but generally the Tiziran military performed very well. This, however, would end with the arrival of a new face on the scene- the technologically-advanced humans.\n\nAnd it was in the wars with humanity that the failings of Sumalism would be revealed. The ideology is, by its nature, supremacist and war-hungry. This leaves it inflexible and incapable of working when war ceases to be a viable option. In the case of the human-lizard wars, the majority were fought with the Tizirans as the aggressors- seeking to expand influence and cut down their neighbours to size. With each defeat, there was a failure to learn- instead, revanchism was used to fuel additional support for Sumalist thought and further war, at the expense of more and more lives each time. The primary reason that a relative era of peace has been reached today is that internal conflicts, fuelled by the repeated failings of Sumalism to deliver Tizira its manifest destiny and by the increasing economic and social debt created by war, have become destabilising enough that external war is no longer sustainable.\n\nSumalism remains the dominant ideology amongst the political elite on Tizira. The average populace is largely moving away from it, instead being more in favour of diplomatic solutions, but without a strong push from the top, the parliament seems likely to remain stacked with Sumalist thinkers. However, in recent years, a beacon of hope for the war-weary and pro-diplomatic populace has emerged- the Empress, seeing the writing on the wall, has made important strides with her limited constitutional power against the ideological slump, seeking a more diplomatic foreign policy and throwing support behind the foundation of a galactic community. These ideas are, of course, not held purely out of a naive belief in cooperation, but a pragmatic look at the situation of the empire: if drastic action to cool the heels of Tiziran nationalism and the war-hawkishness of the military is not taken, then the Empire faces collapse, as the population turns further and further against the political elite- including, critically, the Imperial family, unless they are able to make it clear that they are on the side of the people.\n\nHowever, this has not gone unchallenged by the Parliament. In many ways, the political landscape on Tizira is becoming polarised, with pro-parliament and Sumalist thinkers seeking to reduce the Empress\' power and prevent what they view as an undermining of Tiziran power (and importantly, of parliament\'s power), and pro-monarchy and pro-galactic thinkers pushing for a downsizing of the military machine and an end to the Sumalist dominance of politics on Tizira. The stage seems set for a cold war between crown and country, and perhaps even for a true civil war as the two sides continue to undermine each other.', 'Religion', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(20, 'CentCom', 'Culture: The Ashwalkers', '### The Ashwalkers\nSince Nanotrasen first arrived at the scorched hellscape that is Indecipheres, mining expeditions have mysteriously disappeared in the ashy wastes, never to be seen again. At the same time, a new threat emerged- known colloquially as Ashwalkers by the mining crew, these monsters seem similar to the lizards that humanity has known for decades, but rougher and more primal. This is not without reason- the Ashwalkers trace their lineage back to Tizira, but how they came to Indecipheres is another story.\n\nSome 200 years ago, shortly before First Contact with humanity, the lizards created their first FTL-capable vessel- a colony ship, the ICS Thazakto, which would be sent off with the intent of finding a steady source of plasma, a material which was in extremely limited supply around Rizkalon. This material showed excellent promise as fuel for starships and (perhaps most importantly) as a way to breach the light-speed barrier and revolutionise transport. And so, lizardkind would pour some of their limited resources into an experimental vessel to take advantage of this miracle material, and importantly to locate a more permanent and substantial supply for future use. In a grand ceremony, the Thazakto pierced the light-speed barrier, and vanished into the great beyond. And then, there was nothing. Tizira never heard again from the pioneers aboard the ship.\n\nOn the other side of the artificial wormhole, chaos ensued. The trip had created an electromagnetic pulse, a risk of FTL travel unknown to the unexperienced lizards. Worse still, the Thazakto found itself caught in the gravity well of a nearby planet immediately on dropping from FTL speed, and the already weakened ship found itself unable to escape. The damage was severe, and of the crew of 600, only 120 emerged from the smouldering wreckage on what was to be their new home- a lava-drenched hellscape, where ash hung heavy in the air. Indecipheres.\n\nThe ship was reorganised into a makeshift shelter, and the survivors knew they would need to adapt to survive. Laws relaxed. Order crumbled. And then, the lizards made a dark discovery: the Necropolis, and its dark tendrils.\n\nWhile they would resist at first, it was not long before a combination of hunger, the breakdown of society, and the incessant, ceaseless whispering of the Necropolis would take its toll and drive them insane. And with insanity came a new purpose: serving the voices within their heads. The Necropolis would reward this loyalty in the only way it knew how: to bring them into the fold more thoroughly. By the proxy of their fetish of worship, the Great Tendril, the Necropolis feeds from their sacrifices and creates new Ashwalkers in its twisted image from remains.\n\nAnd so, the Ashwalkers stand, wearing their new titles as custodians proudly, hunting invaders with spear and claw, and protecting the Necropolis until their souls return to it.\n\n### On Rehabilitation of Ashwalkers\n\nWhile the psychological and physiological alterations brought about by the Necropolis are numerous and severe, Ashwalkers are still Lizards at their core, and Nanotrasen scientists have, via extensive testing, found some success in rehabilitating ashwalkers taken from the surface of Indecipheres. Via removal of exposure from the Necropolis, alongside careful reintroduction to normal lizard living conditions and the social environment of the station, some ex-ashwalkers have had their Necropolis Adaptation reversed, and been successfully reintegrated with normal society where they serve as a novel source of labour for Nanotrasen\'s spinward stations. Many more, however, have died during attempts, or been driven mad in the process.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),

According to folklore, names are inextricably bound to the owner, like a key to their soul that must be protected or face terrible consequences should anyone with ill intentions discover it. In more modern times, revealing one\'s own name has become a symbol of great personal trust. It is a matter so rarely discussed that it\'s not unheard of for some moths to forget their own name.\n\nFor this reason, no official name is recognized on the fleet. Every citizen is assigned an identification number that will be used for all official matters. Colloquially moths address one another in various ways such as by nickname, rank, occupation, the ship they are serving on, physical attributes or mannerisms (examples: "Stutters", "Rude Bartender", "Ship Engineer", "One-Eye Captain"). Ironically, this means moths will have not just one but several different names each depending on a specific context and you may even hear conversations between two moths talking about the same person using different names. This tends to cause confusion with outsiders, though the moths seem very well accustomed to this method, sometimes even using it with other races out of habit.\n\nTo allow identification within human society, moths are eventually required to pick their own legally recognized name. Some regard this as a meaningless formality and will pick at random, while others, seeing it as an opportunity to further exploit their amicable appearance, may choose a name that humans could find cute or amusing, much to the chagrin of the officials that have to approve the requests.\n\n### Fleet Day and the Festival of the Errant Lights\n\n> "You can\'t be lost if you don\'t know where to go. So follow the wind, for it knows the way."  \n> -Old Mothic Proverb\n\nFleet Day, one of the most anticipated festivities of the fleet, sees all of the fleet mothkind congregate around the various capital ships for a rare day of merry leisure. It is also a rare occasion for outsiders to witness the fleet\'s bustling life, as during the festivities they tend to be more tolerant than usual to tourists.\nClosing the festivities is the so-called Festival of the Errant Lights, a symbolic reenactment of the start of the fleet\'s journey towards the vast unknown. Each moth is encouraged to bring a lantern (or any other light-emitting device) which will be jettisoned out of the ship along with thousands of others. \nAlthough most will contribute simple lanterns, each year some of the most creative and ingenious fleet members compete to create the most beautiful and impressive lighting contraption, with competition seemingly becoming more and more fierce each year as the creators try to one-up each other.\nThose lucky enough to witness the festivities are often impressed about the spectacular lightshow created by the thousands of lights drifting out into space.\nFinding one of these festival lanterns out space is said to bring good luck, a rare occurrence for the fleet as they tend to not linger in the same area for long. It is, however, a sentiment rarely shared by those "lucky" enough to have the newly formed debris field smash into their hull.\n\n### Sparkweed\n\n> "They sure know how to throw a party, I tell ya what. The speed they go through the stuff... if you told me they needed it to survive I\'d believe it. Then again, with those work hours, maybe they do."  \n> -Testimony from a former smuggler\n\nOne of the few surviving plants originating from the moth homeworld and arguably the most obiquitous, the fleet is known to produce an enormous quantity of Sparkweed thanks to it\'s many uses as a recreational substance as well as the speed and ease with which it can grow in the right conditions.\nIt is an aquatic plant growing on a central stem with pinnate leaves and a purple-reddish color, it requires a minimum temperature of 45°C to grow and can survive up to 120°C.\nThe otherwise prohibitively expensive amount of heating required for any conventional hydroponic setup was no match for mothic ingenuity: by hooking up the hydroponic tanks to the to the ship engines\' cooling systems, Sparkweed became nearly cost-free to produce. Even outside of dedicated hydroponic ships, some of the more enterprising captains occasionally jury-rig their own small scale production.\nSparkweed stems and leaves can be either chewed or dried and steeped in hot water, while the roots are smoked akin to a cigarette (called "Afterburners") thanks to their spongy structure acting as a natural filter.\nIt has a mild euphoric effect and gives a feeling of warmth. High dosage poses no particular danger, although long term excess tends to cause "the shakes", a persistent sense of anxiety and shivering. This condition can be easily remedied by stopping consumption for a few days, though it is widespread enough to have contributed to the moths\' reputation of always being on edge.\nWhat little is known about its origins has been passed through generations: it would grow exclusively in the scorching waters of volcanic geysers and was a staple for enduring the freezing temperatures of the planet\'s colder side.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(22, 'CentCom', 'Species: The Moths', '# The Moths\n\n> "Hey, Bug-Eyes. I think you got the wrong door, the outfitters is two blocks down."  \n> -Anonymous Moth recounting their experience as the first of their kind to walk into a formerly human-only restaurant, following the creation of the Species Equality Act.\n\n## Description:\n\nThe Moths originally hail from a world that has since been lost, though how exactly the moths came to forget where their own planet is confuses everyone- everyone, it seems, except the moths. Apocryphal tales of the planet are passed down through generations, describing its remarkable geography- it was tidally locked, and split into two halves as a result- upon the sun-facing side grew a vast jungle, full of life, while on the dark side an arctic wasteland formed, bitter and cold year round. And from these two sides, came two different types of moth- the hardy, cold resistant frost moths, and the lighter, fun loving moss moths. The cultural and physiological differences between the two sides run deep, however they have come to reconcile their differences due to their new living arrangements, aboard the Grand Nomad Fleet.\n\nMothkind now *mostly* lives aboard the Grand Nomad Fleet, an impressive armada of thousands of ships, from tiny shuttles to hulking capital ships, kept afloat by the combined efforts of every moth living aboard the vessels. In order to keep them running, the moths trade resources harvested from regions the fleet passes by to other civilizations in exchange for crucial parts. Many moths, in support of the fleet, thereby depart from it to work within the ranks of corporations, with the intention of sending money and resources to their families back home. And this is how moths came to live and work alongside the other species of the galaxy.\n\nThe moths have had a bumpy past with humanity- following first contact, raids on human vessels by moth pirates were common, however the nature of the attacks was anything but. The moths would arrive, disable the ship, and board, taking as many salvagable parts as they could, all while doing their best to harm nobody aboard their target vessel. Particular preference was given by these fluffy raiders for particularly glowy parts, including (most notably) the ships\' uranium power cores, which led to an epidemic of ships being stranded on minimal power in the outer rim for some time. As contact between the two species increased, their piratical ways gave way to trading (most of the time, anyway). In the decades since, moths have become easily the most accepted xeno species by humanity, likely due to their amicable nature and humanlike mannerisms.\n\nAs to why the moths have not settled down and founded a colony to serve as a new homeworld, many speculate. Some believe that they are just happy aboard their fleet, and see no need to settle. Others reckon that they\'re searching for their home planet, to reclaim their lost heritage. Others still believe that the moths are perfectionists, and will accept only a perfect substitute for home. Regardless of their true reasoning, one thing is clear- the moths are here to remain on the galactic stage, and few seem to want this to change.\n\n***\n\n# Fun Factoids\n\n* Moths are quite sociable, particularly amongst members of their own species, due to living in the tight quarters of the Grand Nomad Fleet.\n\n* The antennas of a moth serve as a receptor for their keen sense of smell.\n\n* Moths have a very keen sense of smell. It is their primary sense for perceiving the world, and they are often big fans of perfumes which they can coat themselves in. Their antennae serve as their main olfactory receptor, as they have no noses. (How do they smell? Like whatever they doused themselves in.)\n\n* Moths are very cute and fluffy, which tends to make them adorable to humans. They are very aware of this fact, and often tend to use it to their advantage.\n \n* Their "fluff" is more akin to scales than human hair. It is used for sensory input and will glimmer upon falling off. As a show of dramatism, Moths are known to shake themselves violently to throw off a cloud of shimmering, glittery scales.\n\n* Moth wings are near useless outside of low gravity environments- this does not stop them from priding themselves on their wings and flaunting them around. This is because their wings are particularly precious to them, and most Moths will defend them with their lives.\n\n* Moths are generally not very good in fights. They shock easily, they\'re susceptible to bright flashes, and so on. Most opt to take the peaceful route instead. When forced to fight, they instinctively scratch rather than bite.\n\n* Some of the more isolated moths have their own religion which is based around space moth deities. These deities appear to represent positive ideals that shine through the darkness of existence and the moths frequently call themselves lightseekers. This religion calls for isolative exploration of the self, which leads adherents to live isolated lives in solitude, counter to moth nature, and very hard to find aboard the Fleet.\n\n* Moths by nature are very considerate of others and this extends to other species. They often think about their companions before they think about themselves. As a result, they also tend to avoid confrontation, and will frequently use flowery or deceptive language when saying negative things about other people.\n\n* By no means do moths believe they can physically intimidate other creatures and instead opt for underhanded tactics.\n\n* Mothra is a very popular hero among the Moth community and most conflicts in Kaiju conventions are usually caused by uppity Moths.\n\n* Despite being slightly taller than humans on average, moths accustomed to the relatively higher human standard gravity compared to the fleet tend to develop a somewhat hunched over posture due to the weight of their wings, making them appear much shorter. Although they can adapt without ill effects, long term exposure to high gravity tends to make this posture change permanent, making fleet-based moths a rather standout sight in human territories.\n\n***\n\n# Racial Tensions\n\nRacial tensions with the Moths have dramatically declined since the initial conflicts of first contact, however this does not mean that everything is peachy between them. Many surveys find that humans are much more positively inclined towards Moths than other xeno lifeforms, and the feeling is mutual. This may be why Moths have managed to dodge the racially-motivated violence that is common to the other xenos.\n\n***\n\n### Moth Technology\nIt is no secret that moths are at the forefront of ship technology. Having a culture that breeds excellence in engineering (mostly because keeping deathtraps running is a tricky prospect) alongside a flat societal structure that means anyone with an idea is capable of attempting to put it in practice means that mothic ship engineers are amongst the best in the galaxy. To this end, most systems on vessels of the Grand Nomad Fleet are tinkered with and optimised to incredible degrees- although at the cost of being tempramental and difficult to repair for almost anyone except the moths themselves.\n\n***\n\n## Life aboard the Grand Nomad Fleet: "Authoritarian by Necessity"\n\nFor the moths, life is very different to what we experience on Earth, by the necessity of living aboard a massive fleet of old, scrappy ships.\n\nDue to the restrictions placed on space for growing food and manufacturing, much of the supplies necessary to maintain the populations\' needs and health must be sourced from outwith the fleet, and as such a rationing system has been put in place to give everyone their fair share. Each citizen is given a weekly ration of 7 main meals served at a licensed canteen (1 for each day), 5 smaller mid-day meals served at a licensed canteen (1 for each workday), and a package of discretionary credits which can be redeemed at a commissary for snacks, breakfast supplies, and luxury items. In cases of illness, injury, or rearing young, two full meals will be provided each day. The licensed canteens where these meals are supplied are communal areas and generally garner a convivial atmosphere, as the moths gather to eat their food with friends and family and forget the harshness of life aboard the fleet for a short while. Alcohol is qualified as a luxury and can be purchased with discretionary credits, either at the canteens or at specialised bars. There are a few days on which restrictions are relaxed: on public holidays workers are relieved of their duties and food is served without a need for ration tickets.\n\nAll aboard the fleet must contribute to keeping it running, be that via maintenance, service jobs, medical work, or (in rare cases) working outwith the fleet to gather cash which can be used by the fleet for purchasing supplies. Typically moths will be trained in more than one area of expertise, allowing them to be flexible to the needs of the fleet. Those who do not contribute receive only the barest essentials of rations, and if their mooching goes on for too long, they will be dragged before the Admiralty to be forced to accept a career, or face exile from the fleet- there is no room for leeches.\n\nAt the age of 12 moths will enter the workforce assisting with light tasks that are generally safe alongside vocational training for their future career and their education. Later, at the age of 18, they will transfer to their new career and begin working. Those who stay closer to home to work will transfer ship upon turning 18, in an effort to maintain genetic diversity amongst the species. They will stay aboard their new vessel for life in most cases, forming a close bond with their new neighbours.\n\nLiving arrangements aboard the fleet are suitably spartan: the best possible place to live is aboard the ex-colony ships or old civilian vessels, as they have larger, more spacious crew quarters which are purpose built for comfortable living. More commonly, however, moths can expect repurposed rooms shoddily divided into individual apartments, with shared bathroom facilities and very little actual privacy. In the worst cases, they may need to share these spaces, or even worse, have to live in dorms with a number of other moths. While they are a communal species, moths do appreciate some privacy every now and then.\n\nGiven it is made up of thousands of old vessels, and the Moths\' legacy of piracy, the Grand Nomad Fleet has a number of vessel types making up its ranks: everything from old colony ships, to military vessels, ancient trade haulers, entertainment barges (where moths can go on their days off to enjoy themselves), engineering and construction ships, and hundreds of smaller vessels which carry only a small crew.\n\n***\n\n# Smugglers, Privateers and Exiles\n\n>"Some of your cargo is being requisitioned. Stay put, do not approach the cargo bay and we\'ll all be on our merry way soon. Your vessel\'s systems have been disabled until then. Have a nice day."  \n> -Recorded hail from an unidentified mothic pirate ship\n\nDespite criminality in the fleet being almost absent, partially thanks to lax regulations in regards to narcotics and contraband, the same can\'t be said about the numerous pirate and smuggler crews that operate from within it. Although officially operating outside of its control, the fleet will often turn a blind eye to their activities as long as they keep contributing to the fleet\'s upkeep.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this has often put a strain on diplomatic relations. In an effort to remain under the radar, most crews adhere to an unofficial "honor code" that most importantly forbids any type of violence, which has contributed to the moths\' reputation of being peace-loving to a fault. Yet the truth is much less glamorous: it is a code followed not for honor, but self-preservation as the fleet will immediately rescind any support and outlaw any crew found guilty of violent crimes to avoid any major diplomatic incidents.\n\nBut outside of these caveats the fleet is remarkably tough on criminality, which has greatly contributed in maintaining its mostly crime-free status.\n\n# Fleet Exiles\n\n> "Anyone who goes against our cause in favor of their egoistic desires is not just a criminal but also a traitor. The Fleet Authority may be lenient but I am not. Find me a replacement, they are not getting on my ship."  \n> -Captain Sabresplit, high ranking fleet officer, refusing to take on crew with previous convictions\n\nAs the fleet does not include long term imprisonment as a punishment, disciplinary action ranges from having discretionary credits docked or temporary suspension from other fleet benefits, while major offences may result in permanent exile. Punishments for repeat offenders typically become exponentially more severe.\n\nThe fleet has been often criticized for seemingly weighting judgement around the collective interests of the fleet more so than what human society would call a sense of just punishment, with disproportionate sentences for underperforming members while capable crew may be able to get away with a slap on the wrist for something that would have put the former at risk of major disciplinary action or even exile. Yet most of its members still defend this practice as being a necessity, as the tough life on the fleet does not allow the luxury of harboring troublemakers who can\'t pay back for their misdeeds.\n\nAfter being sentenced, exiles are afforded transportation to a nearby settlement of their choice. Although not explicitly against the law, keeping contacts with exiles is frowned upon and likely to negatively affect social standing within the fleet, causing most exiles to end up being left to fend for themselves. However, for some it can be the start of a new life of greater individual freedom, for others an opportunity to continue their life of crime unshackled from the influence of the fleet.\n\nNowadays many small communities of moth exiles and their descendants exist, some well adjusted to life among the other races, others preferring to keep for themselves. While the descendants of exiles are able to request membership into the fleet, they will be required to completely sever all ties with their family and friends should their request be approved.\n\n***\n\n# Speculations\n\nAs is to be expected of any group which can provide exceptional services, mothic engineers often travel from the fleet to take up positions with the other species of the galaxy, usually demanding a king\'s ransom to do so. In return, the hiring organisation will find themselves with the highest quality of ship designs that money can buy- at least until their contract expires, at which point they had best hope they\'ve trained the rest of their engineers sufficiently well to keep their systems at peak capacity.\n\nMothic Engineers have been behind many successes from many companies, including making designs for Azik Interstellar, Cybersun Industries, Donk Co, and even Nanotrasen- for whom the moths were responsible for several station innovations.\n\n***', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(23, 'CentCom', 'Species: Plasmamen', '# Plasmamen: A New Kind of Worker\n\nWhile Plasmamen may, to the layman\'s eyes, look like merely purple skeletons, this does not tell the truth of the incredible complexity of the organisms that make them tick. For Plasmamen are not merely one organism, but millions, known as Colonids.\n\nThe Colonids are microscopic, plasma-based fungi, which form large networks with other Colonids. These colonies can eventually stretch to include billions of the organisms, with the collective forming a single cohesive social unit. Originally being discovered as a purple fungus around liquid plasma pools on the Icemoon, Freyja, Colonids were overlooked until Nanotrasen researchers discovered that they produced small electrical impulses. Further investigation revealed that these impulses were a simulacrum of nerve signals, and the researchers were curious enough to investigate whether these creatures may be a form of intelligent life.\n\nIt was these tests that would reveal the true potential of Colonids- during a routine inspection, Marcel Delacroix, a researcher assigned to the project, slipped and fell into a tank of liquid plasma which had been opened to test the Colonid content. Marcel died as a result of plasma exposure, and hasty preparations were made to recover his corpse from the tank. However, as his coworkers rushed to gather their gear, their attention was drawn to the tank by a series of banging noises. And they were then horrified to see Marcel, skin and muscle sloughed off to the skeleton, and covered in a fine purple membrane, stand up and begin staggering around. When dragging him out of the tank, he burst into flames, and was only extinguished when placed into an inert environment, at which point he began suffocating. Plasma was quickly flooded in- and so it was discovered that Colonids require a plasma rich environment, be that liquid or gaseous, to survive.\n\nTests were ran on the creature that used to be Marcel, and it was found that it possessed human-like intelligence- however, no trace of Marcel\'s personality remained. It was clear that this was a new being, which merely inhabited his corpse. Further testing showed that the plasmaman was quite capable of learning Common, manipulating its skeletal mouth and forming vocal cords to further improve its capabilities. Its anatomy was found to quite closely mirror that of humanity, but exclusing several organs which were clearly deemed as extraneous. To allow it to leave his containment cell, it was given an EVA suit flooded with a mixture of nitrogen and plasma, which prevented it from catching fire. And so, unwillingly, Marcel Delacroix became the first plasmaman as we know them today.\n\nFollowing this discovery, Nanotrasen initially saw potential for these new beings in military applications- however, trials revealed that they were simply too frail to be of any use on the battlefield, and besides- they had free will, and a surprising number of the newfound species were more interested in cooking, or studying law, or any number of other pursuits, than in wanton murder. Frustration with the project ended up turning to excitement for corporate, however, when Nanotrasen realised that these new beings would be excellent for shoring up gaps in their workforce, as they required few of the amenities or even basic necessities that organic workers need to survive.\n\nAnd so, the plasmaman became Nanotrasen\'s newest type of worker- reanimated corpses, ready to do mundane labour for little to no pay. However- plasmamen present a unique problem in the workforce- their propensity to catch fire. Hence, the creation of the Envirosuit was necessary to exploit this new workforce.\n \n# The Suit \n \nThe plasma envirosuit we know and love(?) today is an elegant blend of cost-effectiveness and ease of use (especially in the venue of neutralizing rowdy skeletons via helmet removal). \n \nAside from this emergency use case, releasing burning plasma out (and burning oxygen in) at every little scratch is not ideal, thus the fabric of the envirosuit is made of two layers of heavily coated and tightly woven synthetic threads, with a layer of an extremely sticky and hard to wash glue-like substance sandwitched in the middle (the formula, though protected by corporate secret, is known to include tritium hydrocarbons less common than plasma). \n\nThanks to this design, in case of a slash or rip in the fabric of the suit it can easily be mended through the simple application of pressure, and the built-in extinguisher charge does the rest. \n \nSaid extinguisher charge is little more than a manually-toggled water dispenser located behind the vertebrae, which effectively reduces the plasma colonids\' typical dryness (the leading hypothesis for the cause of such a low humidity is their tendency to rapidly absorb liquid water for hydrogen, an element which the organisms are always quite eager to consume). \n\nPlasmaman gloves are, contrary to popular belief, integral for the envirosuit to work. \n \nThey\'re internally coated with thick memory foam to adapt to the sometimes lumpy boney fingers, and externally coated with thin but resilient rubber to maintain sensitivity and control in the hands. The hands on the envirosuit itself are one of the weakest spots on it due to these reasons. \n \nYou might be thinking to yourself: this is all well and good, but, say, if a plasmaman has to, for example, put on glasses, are they screwed? The answer is, kind of! While the helmet is easy to quickly unscrew and equip again, such an operation can only be conducted safely under a shower, in an inert environment, or in the dangerous vacuum of space, unless the user is brave (or stupid) enough and quick with their reflexes.\n \n# Reception\nThe crew of the stations to which plasmamen were tentatively introduced oddly didn\'t react all too poorly to the new colleagues. In the  words of Space Station 8\'s Captain Lucio Spurgis: "I\'ve been through so much shit lately I barely noticed the purple guys coming out of arrivals." \n \nSpace Station 5\'s Chief Engineer Ruth Blarbo instead remarks "They\'re cool I guess, they mostly spend their time tanning at the supermatter. It\'s a step up from the human staff who actively delaminate it just for kicks." \n \nNot everyone has reacted as positively, however. The Animal Rights Consortium and other ethics organizations have taken the news of a new species made of human corpses and alien goop being introduced to Nanotrasen stations, and especially the horror stories about envirosuit testing (how many had to burn before the product reached the market?) particularly badly, and have been steadily extending their Nanotrasen Book Of Grudges, motivating the rest of the Syndicate ever more for the next attack.\n\n# Fun Factoids:\n* Since Colonids are native to the Icemoon, the liquid plasma pools on the moon are teeming with them. Falling into one of these pools may result in becoming the next Marcel Delacroix.\n* Plasmamen can infest any skeleton, or really any organic surface- those seen on Nanotrasen stations are generally human skeletons, as Nanotrasen is able to source them cheaply from the bodies of convicts. Yes, this means plasmamen can infest things like dinosaur skeletons, and yes, this is badass.\n* Plasmamen have very human mannerisms, due mostly to their integration with human society on the frontier. That said, they have developed their own distinct culture in their short time on the galactic stage.\n* Plasmamen are not only immune to radiation, but utilise it very efficiently as an energy source. Even the small amounts given off as background radiation on the Icemoon are sufficient to sustain them.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(24, 'CentCom', 'Species: Exospecies', '# Exospecies of the Galaxy\n> "Space is big. You just won\'t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it\'s a long way down the road to the chemist\'s, but that\'s just peanuts to space."  \n> -Douglas Adams, "The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy"\n\nThroughout space, dozens of unique species and cultures exist. So much so, that humanity has limited contact with many of them. In this page, details of some of the lesser seen species (to humans, anyway) of the Milky Way are given.\n\n## The Vigox\nThe Vigox are a mercantilist species of Avianoids, well known to the Tizirans but rarely seen in human space. Described as tall, stocky and viciously intelligent carrion birds, the Vigox are imposing, and their nature as obligate carnivores who like their meat raw does little to make them more welcoming. Their home system is located on the opposite side of Tiziran space to Earth, and their home planet of Amadea is harsh, with scrubby foliage and black sands under a baking hot sun, from which the Vigox built a small but powerful galactic empire. A number of valuable goods are produced in their domain, under the control of dozens of corporate entities- who all compete for influence and power. Despite everything, the one thing the Vigox corporations hate more than each other is the idea of being invaded, so in the face of increasing risk from surrounding nations, particularly the Tizirans, they banded together into a loose-knit confederation.\n\nTheir planetary leadership is the Central Vigox Directorate, an oligarchic council headed by a president they refer to as the Chief Executive, who is "elected" to their position for a period of 10 years in a bidding war between companies that frequently turns violent. Even when there is "peace" between the various corporations, political violence and assassination is common. \n\nGoods from the Vigox are sold on to nearby states, and then again onwards to proliferate outwards. Humanity gets most of their Vigox-made goods via a particular space-shipping corridor known as the Amadea Run, running through Tiziran space. As a result, anything Vigox-made carries a heavy premium in human space due to the dues paid to the lizards to get it through- except those that can be smuggled through, which results in an odd situation where the black market for Vigox goods in human space is both cheaper and more well-stocked than legal channels.\n\nThe primary goods sourced from the Vigox include:\n* A proprietary ceramic-metal composite material, known as Siroc, that is useful for making armour (and is produced by a technique unknown to other species);\n* Pearl Lustre and Lustrine, narcotic drug and potent painkiller respectively, considered similar to opiates with a lower risk of addiction;\n* A number of exotic and interesting fruits and spices which are now prized in high-class cooking.\n\n## The Terintans\nThe galaxy is an old place, and as such, there are species that have had their time in the sun- taken to space, grown to an empire, and then unceremoniously and inexplicably ceased to exist. The Terintans are one such race of "precursors". An insectoid species, the Terintans were somewhat similar to terrestial beetles. Their wings, hard carapaces, four arms, and compound eyes would have made them an imposing sight on their own, but the Terintans also had another defining physical characteristic- their remarkable height. Estimates place the average height of a Terintan male at around 9ft, and some armour measuring to 13ft has been uncovered. Female drones were somewhat smaller at around 8ft, but the true titans of Terintan society were the Queens, whose chambers in ancient ruins would suggest they grew to around 30ft long.\n\nEvidence points to the Terintans having been a warrior culture, and a particularly bloody one at that. Trials by combat appear to have been common, as well as duels of honour. Much of their society seems to have been dedicated to servicing the military machine, with limited cultural advancement outside of that provided by their dominating religion. Their hive worlds place a lot of emphasis on grand temples and military buildings, with little set aside for living or other public works.\n\nThe Terintan Empire is believed to have been quite large, even in comparison to contemporary states, with evidence of their existance found from locations as close as the Spinward Sector to some as far flung as the Core Tiziran Empire.\n\nIt is unknown exactly why the Terintans ceased to exist, but some evidence seems to point towards a series of disasters hitting the empire at the same time. While weakened, one of their many troubles finished them off, but historians are unsure whether this was a disease, an invasion, or some sort of major ecological disaster on their homeworld killing off an irreplaceable number of Queens, leaving their society to atrophy- certainly, all of these occurred, but which was the final nail is a point of debate. One thing is for certain, however- while they may be gone, they\'ve left their mark on the galaxy. Many ancient hive-worlds still exist, although the ruins are covered over by millenia of erosion. The most well known to humanity is Ancienne in the Spinward Sector, which is remarkably well preserved.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(25, 'CentCom', 'Culture: Languages and Trade Tongues', '# Languages and Trade Tongues of the Galaxy\n\nAs the galaxy rapidly becomes more interconnected, spoken language becomes a bigger and bigger concern. Language diversity even within the borders of a single empire is huge, with colonisation of worlds breeding new dialects and languages- not to mention the existing spread of languages on the capital alone. With this in mind, the creation of simplfied, standardised "trade tongues" has been of critical importance for facilitating both intra- and interspecies trade.\n\n### Humanity\nAs is to be expected of a people as fiercely independent and nationalistic as humanity, individual languages have not died out. While a small number of languages account for the majority of native speakers within TerraGov space, there are still thousands of discrete languages spoken across human space. Major languages include English, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Hindi and Russian. In addition to the traditional languages, a number of "union languages" have formed within humanity, mostly to facilitate cross-borders cooperation. Examples include Eurocommon, Unified Arabic Script, Latinoamericano, Pan-Maritime-Asiatic, Neo-Turkic, and many others. None, however, have become as dominant as the language of business on Earth- Anglosinitic, or as it is more commonly (and perhaps brashly) known, Galactic Common. Galactic Common was adopted as humanity\'s official "trade tongue" around the time of first contact, to be used as a standard communication method with alien species. To this end, learning Galactic Common as a second language is extremely common on Earth, with around 99.5% of the world\'s population being fluent in its use.\n\nWithin humanity, however, knowledge of a foreign language is generally a formality. While humans tend to be fluent in at least their native language and Galactic Common, and often in their nation\'s "union language", translation software for human tongues is widespread and cheaply available- allowing for quick and easy understanding of almost any other human via instantaneous translation.\n\nColonial languages have also sprung up, mostly as creoles born of the varied settlers who came to live there. A key example is Martian- a language created by the melting pot of East Asian, European and American settlers, and then contributed to by people of all creeds and colours. Martian is an extremely diverse language, although learners who are already familiar with Sinitic, Japonic, Latin or Germanic tongues are likely to recognise at least a few of the words. Colonial languages are also shaped by their distance from the controlling hand of Earth- an example being the Novorusskii language of the SSC, which has developed along alternate lines to standard Home Russian along the past few centuries. While its differences are not as stark as Martian versus its mother languages, the differences are still great enough that a speaker of one will struggle to fully understand the other- even if the two are mostly mutually intelligible.\n\n### Lizardkind\nLizardkind has a similar situation to humanity: several thousand languages are still spoken across Tizira, and the wider empire as a whole. The most common language is Oskmarzelisk (colloquially known to humans as High Draconic), spoken in the previous United Kingdom of Oskmarzel, where the capital Zagoskeld is located. Other major languages include Valyngisk, Noqsisk, Tremonde, Allma, and Fermalisk. A variant of Oskmarzelisk is also used as the Empire\'s "trade-tongue", known to humans as Draconic.\n\nLizard society is generally less accomodating with language variation than humanity. While thousands of languages are used, Oskmarzelisk is the only official language in the Empire and has been for the past 200 years, used for all official communications, trade and business, as well as being the language of schooling and the military. To this end, the language is spoken fluently across almost the entire empire, and other languages are sidelined in its favour. This has led to a decline in the Empire\'s other languages, which many view as an attempt by the central government to culturally dominate the planet and reduce regional autonomy.\n\n### Moths\nThe Moths have a complicated history with language, possibly because their language is quite complex in itself. Traditional Mothic is a language of two halfs- the spoken component is important, but the true meaning of a moth\'s words are conveyed via body language- movements of the eyes, antennae and wings. This naturally creates problems for interspecies communication, and as such the admiralty board recommends the use of a standardised form of mothic omitting body language. This is frequently called "Phrasebook Mothic" and contains over twice the number of words that Traditional Mothic does- mostly to convey emotion, intent, and anything else which would ordinarily be handled by body language.\n\nLanguage amongst the moths is as diverse as the fleet is large, with almost every ship having its own variance from Traditional Mothic. The standards set forward by the fleet authorities are not frequently used on the ships of the fleet. Most moths instead will learn the local dialect of the ships they frequently visit, and attempt to wing it should they need to travel beyond that. The only real exception to this is when moths travel beyond the fleet itself, as the trade tongue is the only one that most non-moths are familiar with. As a result, moths off of the fleet tend to use Phrasebook Mothic such that they can actually be understood by non-moths (via the aid of translation equipment).\n\n### Ethereals\nFollowing the Ethereal uplifting by humanity, Galactic Common became the official language of the Ethereal people. Since then, it has grown to become dominant amongst the Ethereals, with around 70% of the population in TerraGov space speaking it fluently. Several loanwords and slang terms from the Ethereals have become commonplace within this population, having unofficially become part of the GalCom dictionary.\n\nAmongst Ethereal employees of corporations, methods of concealing communication have become popular, allowing ethereals to complain about their working conditions and bosses without drawing attention from their employers. To this end, a semi-official "language" has been adopted by many ethereals in this situation, known colloquially as Voltaic. Via manipulation of electrical discharge in their throat (not dissimilar to Mongolian throat-singing), Ethereals are capable of producing a morse-code like series of sparks and jolts, which is used as a method of talking without talking. Coupled with their impressive range of hearing, the Ethereals can use this to communicate away from prying ears.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(26, 'CentCom', 'Science: Communications in the Bluespace Age', '# Communications in the Bluespace Age\n>"Greetings. You have connected to the Nanotrasen Spinward Communications Service. Be advised that use of this service is restricted to Nanotrasen personnel. Please be prepared to provide your Employee ID..."\n \n-Automated voice on connection to the Nanotrasen Spinward Comms Service.\n \nSince the invention of satellite communications, humanity has been strongly interconnected. Communications between opposite sides of the world could be done within milliseconds- real time calls, messaging, and the transfer of information and data in the blink of an eye. This changed somewhat as humanity spread to space- as distances grew larger, communication between the extremities of human space became harder. Throughout the space age, a wide array of galactic institutions and technological innovations were necessary to keep humanity connected, no matter where they went within human space.\n \n### Comms Buoys\nThe workhorse of galactic communication, comms buoys act as broadcasters, receivers and relays for interstellar communications. The technology involved is not trivial- across the massive distances involved signals tend to become faint, being muddied by background noise and simply lost amongst the cosmos. Comms buoys, therefore, have to act to amplify and restore signals.\n \nMost occupied systems in human space have a comms buoy. In core space, TerraGov operates a public network of these buoys, providing free communications to all citizens and registered vessels- although this network is far from the best available. Private companies also offer their own networks with faster speeds and other benefits. In the further reaches of human space, TerraGov does not operate a public network, leaving communications firmly in the hands of private companies. This makes talking to core space from the extremities an expensive process: as an example, the Spinward Stellar Coalition\'s state-owned comms company, Kosmokomm, offers internal data transfer at a rate of 5 credits/gigabyte of data transferred. For external transfer, this increases exponentially with distance- when factoring in line-time rental from other companies and interservice expenses, this rate creeps to 200 credits/gigabyte when sending/receiving data from Earth. The expense coupled with generally slow transfer rates (realtime transfer is even more expensive, so most opt for slower rates) mean that the extremities of human space are remote and have difficulties with communication.\n \nSome companies (mostly the largest ones) operate their own comms networks. News organisations are one such group, typically operating services both such that they can broadcast news to customers, and so that they can rapidly receive information from all corners of human space. Megacorporations are another group that makes extensive use of private comms networks- Nanotrasen\'s network is the largest in the galaxy, stretching across the entirety of human space. Other companies such as Cybersun Industries and Interdyne Pharmaceutics have similar, but smaller, networks. For megacorporations, rapid communications are key to projecting power across the galaxy.\n \nComms buoys are also responsible for maintaining the Extranet across human space. For those in central space, the Extranet is a lightning fast repository of information, much like the internet of centuries gone by. For those in the furthest reaches, the Extranet is a lot like the old days of Dial-Up, with slow loading and painful download times.\n\n### TGFPS (TerraGov Federal Postal Service)\nFor delivery of physical items, the TGFPS is TerraGov\'s state-operated postal service, offering a (relatively) cheap method of transporting mail and packages across human space.\n \nStamp collecting remains a popular hobby amongst mail enthusiasts, and with the wide variety of stamps made across human space there are plenty to collect.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(27, 'CentCom', 'Science: Materials of the Bluespace Age', '# Materials of the Bluespace Age\n\n### Plasma\nPlasma is a novel compound, first discovered by mankind in limited quantities on Mars in the Amenthes region, from which it draws its scientific name, Amenthium. Various "ores" of plasma exist, including Amenthite, Memnonite, Thaumasiatite, and Hellasite, each with varying amounts of plasma and other impurities, and almost all coming from the vast plasma mines of Mars. Of these, Amenthite is the most commonly found in human space, comprised of around 78% plasma, with 17% silicon and 5% trace impurities including iron oxides and carbon.\n\nPlasma is held as being almost wholly responsible for enabling humanity\'s rapid ascension into the space age and beyond, as it is instrumental in the creation of viable engines for long distance space travel- however, the supplies found within easy reach of Earth are quite finite, and to sustain the modern plasma-based economy it was necessary to look further afield in search of larger and larger deposits. Many corporations began private expeditions in search of new sources of the purple stuff, and were generally met with limited success. Cybersun Industries famously found a source of gaseous plasma which could be extracted from a gas giant in a nearby system to Sol, but the expense of this operation limited their financial gain. Other non-viable sources were explored, including extraction from plasma-rich swamps on Hawkings-Eta IV, but very little was to be gained from such expensive methods. Any viable plasma mining operation would need to find a source of solid ores to remain profitable.\n\nAnd then, as part of a speculative expedition into uninhabited space in the Spinward sector, Nanotrasen hit the motherlode. Indescipheres had been known to humanity for decades- it was discovered and charted, but very little surface probing had been undertaken due to its extremely hostile environment. What little data there was suggested remarkable mineral wealth, but no company had been willing to take the financial risk involved with setting up mining operations in deep space on a planet that was so dangerous. As a hail mary, Nanotrasen decided to organise a small expedition to survey the surface in person. What began as a random shot in the dark ended up becoming the largest discovery of plasma in human history, with the funding given for a mining and research outpost to be constructed in orbit of the planet by the end of the day, and construction beginning on "Space Station 13" within 2 weeks. The plasma found on Indescipheres was also of a remarkable purity, with plasma ore from the planet containing as high as 97% plasma content. This ore was named Pudicitite, derived from the Latin word for purity.\n\nAs a result of this find, Nanotrasen now holds close to a monopoly on high-grade plasma within human space. Their competitors, naturally, resent them for this, particularly Cybersun Industries, who are in second place for plasma production (owning a dominating stake in the Martian mines) and seek to usurp the top spot at any cost.\n\nPlasma, while extremely reactive in its base form, forms very stable alloys with numerous metals, including iron (plasteel), titanium (plastitanium), aluminium (plasmalum), and copper (plasma-brass). The chemistry of these reactions is not well developed, but it is expected that plasma is a complex hydrocarbon with a number of possible isomers, which can be transferred between with a sufficient application of energy. At least one of these isomers adopts a crystalline structure, while another has strong but disordered intermolecular interactions, allowing plasma to adopt solid, liquid and gaseous forms at the same temperature- both a scientific curiosity and marvel.\n\n### Bluespace Crystals\nBluespace Crystals first became known to humanity in 2459, following an event that collectively opened the world\'s eyes to the material\'s incredible power. In a near catastrophic event, Zhang\'s Comet deviated from its expected close flyby of Earth into a direct collision course with Toronto, Canada. As TerraGov scrambled to organise an emergency response, the comet suddenly, and incredibly mysteriously, vanished- and reappeared near the Moon, which it promptly crashed into. Investigating the impact crater, researchers were puzzled to find a massive number of brilliant blue crystals in colossal veins throughout the rock- crystals which, when energised, be it by radiation, or heat, or even something as simple as crushing a crystal in the palm of your hand, would result in short range teleportation. Scientists theorised that the comet was hit by a large burst of radiation from a solar flare, resulting in a large scale translocation of the crystals, and, in turn, the comet.\n\nAs testing on the crystals progressed further, researchers discovered that they were no mere mundane material- Bluespace crystals acted as a manifested link to a parallel dimension, which came to be known as the Bluespace. Better technology allowed for the harnessing of this link, leading to the rise of bluespace-based devices and materials. How exactly they link to this parallel dimension is unknown.\n\nFairly rapidly, it was discovered that bluespace crystals could be synthesised via a combination of plasma with diamond at extreme pressure and heat. This discovery, however, was unable to be utilised to its fullest due to the limited supply of plasma with which humanity could experiment. The newfound abundance of plasma from Indescipheres, however, has been instrumental in kickstarting humanity\'s Bluespace Age- with Nanotrasen at the centre of it all.\n\nBluespace technology almost universally focuses on manipulation of space, in ways never before thought possible. Via use of the Bluespace, circuits shrink, massive amounts of storage become possible in handheld packages, and a new form of faster-than-light travel was invented via the Wattson Drive- allowing for incredible FTL travel in a fraction of the time of plasma-based engines. This makes bluespace crystals (and in turn the plasma used for industrial synthesis of them) extremely valuable in almost all areas of science, engineering, and manufacturing.\n\nCurrent areas of bluespace focus include longer and longer range teleportation, further advancements in FTL, the direct and safe use of Bluespace pocket dimensions (which has shown little promising advancement since the disappearance of Doctor A. Hilbert, the leading scientist in this field), and the creation of Bluespace alloys.\n\n### Supermatter\nSupermatter is a novel state of matter, initially found in trace quantities in the gaseous orbit of a neutron star. Scientific analysis has not yet pinpointed exactly *what* supermatter is- however, it is theorised to be formed from extremely dense clusters of ionised gas, which collapses due to extreme forces of pressure into a nominally solid (supermatter is actually better described as an amorphous solid, as it does not possess the rigid structure of a true crystal) and incredibly dense material. Upon contact with materials of standard density, it is capable of ripping them apart, atom by atom, at which point they will be incorporated into the crystal on an atomic level.\n\nDespite the lack of understanding about what Supermatter is, a method of producing viable quantities has been established. Supermatter conglomerate crystals are made via the skimming of these neutron stars to obtain enough material to produce a "seed" crystal. This "seed" is then expanded via the introduction of massive amounts of material in a controlled environment, with particular care given to prevent catastrophic disruption of the lamina, and to avoid making the crystal so dense that it collapses into a singularity. Typically a hypernoble gas environment is used, which keeps the crystal at a safe energy level. Various materials can be used to alter the crystal\'s properties, though again care must be taken to not spike energy production too high (uranium and plutonium are common materials used to increase energy production) lest the crystal become unsustainably energetic and delaminate.\n\nThe crystal maintains stability via the creation of a thin layer of gas which is held by the crystal\'s gravitational pull. This layer, known as a "lamina", keeps the crystal stable, and also allows for the interaction of gases with the crystal superstructure. The decomposition of these gases via contact results in the release of radiation, which has allowed for some experimental power production methods to be set up utilising a large supermatter crystal- working on these prototypes, however, has proven to be a job for the brave or foolhardy. Different gases have different interactions with the crystal.\n\nIn the event that the lamina is allowed to completely dissipate, a delamination event will occur. In this event, the crystalline structure of the supermatter will collapse, resulting in a massive release of energy as the supermatter decays to regular matter. In the event that the crystal is sufficiently dense (due to the surrounding atmosphere being too dense, resulting in a catastrophic gain in density for the crystal that overcomes the stabilising effect of the lamina) it may collapse into a singularity. Needless to say, this is not good. High energy delaminations may result in a remarkable release of energy, including the potential for a release of a tesla-ball.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(28, 'CentCom', 'Science: On the Unnamed Plasma Disease', '# On the Unnamed Plasma Disease\n\nThere are a few aspects of plasma that quickly become clear after being introduced to it: it is purple, highly combustible, and (as anyone who\'s handled a bar of it at room temperature can attest) very poorly named. \n\nThere\'s lots of other interesting and useful properties of plasma that have been teased out with a few years of research and study: its amazing thermodynamic properties, its incredible tensile strength when mixed into alloys, and the immediate toxic effects it has on organic lifeforms when ingested being some of the most notable. These properties have all proven to be extremely useful in a variety of applications, and more importantly, extremely profitable to exploit, making plasma mining and research two of the biggest financial boons in Nanotrasen\'s entire history.\n\nAs the years of research and mining have gone by, however, not all of the information that has come out about plasma has been good. Indeed, some of the most highly classified and secretive research being conducted by NT anywhere is focused on the long-term effects of plasma on humanoids. The short term effects of ingesting plasma in large amounts are clear; it acts as a neurotoxin that causes widespread cell death throughout the victim\'s body. Luckily, these effects can be avoided with a simple oxygen mask, and it doesn\'t take a trained surgeon to tell if someone\'s huffed enough to kill them. Infinitely more insidious, however, are the long term effects. While researchers\' understandings of these effects are constantly changing as more research is produced, clear patterns are emerging where affected individuals suffer from gradual neurological decay, decreased attention span, violent mood swings, and most notably, degraded ability to feel empathy for others.\n\nUsually, these findings are laughed off and treated like a joke when first heard. It makes sense: the Spinward Periphery is a perfect storm for seedy and antisocial behavior, and it\'s not like NT\'s lax approach to hiring standards is helping things. With all the deceit and skullduggery that the average NT crewmember is exposed to, not to mention the occasional outright bloodbath, some would find it more surprising that any moral code could survive beyond "kill or be killed". But if nothing else, the first several waves of employees proved resilient and resourceful, struggling to maintain some sort of personal normalcy and decency among the chaos they found themselves in.\n\n## Research and Discovery\n\n> *"These scans from the last group of subjects are astounding. Here, look at this one- it\'s like the decay is targeted directly at the parts of the brain that help regulate emotions. These are dangerous people, don\'t forget that when you\'re dealing with them."*  \n> --An anonymous veteran researcher, unknowingly studying his own brain scan.\n\nFor the many faults that can be levied against NT\'s management of the Spinward Periphery, its command structure and management selection are remarkably egalitarian. The execs and officers of the first waves of personnel sent to the Spinward Periphery were more than willing to lead from the front and become personally involved in dangerous work when needed, and when it came time to select their successors, they chose from the crewmembers they led in the field. Under intense pressure to deliver from both the corporate offices back home and their colleagues on the Periphery, plus extremely high personnel turnover, traditional barriers to advancement such as ethnicity, gender, and even species took a back seat to credentials and experience in the field. Indeed, while non-humans are still barred from serving as station-side Heads of Staff, as well as being excluded from basic protections in the standard silicon lawsets, every species of humanoid is currently represented in the staff of the higher Spinward Central Command. This isn\'t to say that things are perfectly egalitarian- discrimination still occurs, and there\'s still a strict chain of command- but the CentCom staff are generally sympathetic to the crewmembers they administrate and remember their own time in the field when balancing risks.\n\nSo when signs of this systemic mental and empathetic decay started cropping up among the CentCom staff, they began to take the reports seriously. As research has since revealed, plasma is much harder to fully purge from an area than previously thought, meaning trace amounts of plasma are often circulated through the stale recycled air onboard the stations unbeknownst to the crew. While this trace exposure isn\'t enough to cause the outright poisoning medical staff are trained to spot and treat, it is enough to cause decay over long periods of time. Only now, after almost two decades of NT\'s presence on the Spinward Periphery and several generations of workers and leaders passing through its stations, has the scope of the issue started to become clear.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nThe intensity of the decay seems to roughly correlate with a crewmember\'s length of service and time spent in contaminated areas, but some crewmembers seem more susceptible to the decay than others. Preliminary models estimate that anywhere from 10-35% of crewmembers serving more than one month show minor signs of decay, with estimates reaching as high as 80% after one year, but the truth is that no one is sure how widespread it is. The Spinward Periphery truly is hard on people, and the constant stress and trauma thrown at workers combined with the already rough workforce makes it extremely difficult to identify who is suffering from these effects and to what degree.\n\nIn the meantime, ongoing research on plasma\'s long term effects is strictly classified to the highest degree, and NT has not publicly acknowledged the phenomenon. NT\'s leadership is at a very uneasy crossroads, both highly concerned with the systematic damages their work is causing among the workforce and themselves, but ultimately unwilling to slow down plasma processing until more concrete evidence comes out. Most of the cases appear to be mild so far, and while the decay seems to be resistant to most chemical forms of treatment such as mannitol and neurine, simple cognitive mindfulness exercises have proven useful in offsetting the effects. By being aware of the changes to their mind, patients can still function among more polite society back in Sol, though increased emotional distance and stress when trying to return to their previous lives is very common among ex-crewmembers.\n ', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(30, 'CentCom', 'Corporations: Nanotrasen', '> "Everywhere we go, Nanotrasen\'s already been!"\n\n> -A candid complaint from Laura Kripac, senior TerraGov intelligence officer, after learning Nanotrasen preempted TG on pulse weapon technology by ten years. The quote leaked to the press, and has been an unofficial motto among NT workers ever since. \n***\n\nNanotrasen is a very, very large and important company. A company so large, in fact, that at least half a century has passed since it became large enough to receive a charter from TerraGov to form its own expeditionary fleets and establish its own settlements outside the Sol system. While a large portion of their investments are tied up in Sol, they were notably the first private corporation to be granted such a charter and invest heavily in the distant reaches of space. At the time it was regarded as an incredibly risky gamble, and there was great speculation that all the money spent on exploring space and launching deep space missions would end up a waste that would sink the company, but the gambit has more than paid off and Nanotrasen\'s portfolio has soared since.\n\nPrimarily an advanced research and development conglomerate, Nanotrasen also has skin in many other fields. While a great deal of their income still comes from producing public research funded by government research grants, their operations also include directly producing and selling their most profitable designs, leasing their asset protection forces to governments and private organizations (both space fleets and ground troops), logistics management with a specialization in remote settlement self-sufficiency, and maintaining interstellar communication infrastructures to name a few. The common theme that runs through most of their business ventures is taking the lessons they\'ve learned from operating on such a massive scale and helping smaller organizations stretch themselves.\n\nAs large and powerful as they are, Nanotrasen\'s future standing is still shaky and uncertain as they double down further on their Spinward settlements. Their decision to expand out Spinward on their own came during the dawn of TerraGov\'s efforts to begin scouting out and colonizing Alpha Centauri (Trailward of Sol, in the opposite direction of SS13), and the opportunity cost involved with breaking from TerraGov\'s expansion has been sizable.\n\n\nContents\n\n1. Fields of research\n2. Sub-Entry: Central Command\n3. Sub-Entry: Nanotrasen Division of Asset Protection\n4. Sub-Entry: Nanotrasen Emergency Response Corps\n\n# Fields of research\n\nAs a fancy research company, Nanotrasen does a lot of groundbreaking research, in a vast array of fields. Due to environmental and political factors, some fields of research in particular have been relegated to the Spinward Periphery, away from government eyes.\n\n* Plasma extraction and refining: The original target of the Spinward Space Station project, the use of plasma in energy generation and weapons development is a hot field on the Periphery. Precious little is known about the long-term effects of plasma, but Nanotrasen still makes a pretty penny extracting, refining, and selling it to cash-flush and energy-hungry organizations like TerraGov.\n* Bluespace technology: The science of punching in and out of extra dimensions, whether dealing with man portable hand teleporters and reactive teleport armor, or ship sized FTL Bluespace Drives. While basic Bluespace Theory and FTL travel is known and studied back in Sol, it\'s speculated that Nanotrasen are decades ahead in their private research.\n* Alternative energy sources: Whether it\'s braving the event horizon of a black hole to collect its radiation, detonating an entire hyper-dense planet to extract the supermatter at its core, or any of another half dozen highly dangerous and exotic energy generation methods, NT has no shortage of encouraging research directions here. The interesting work, emphasis on rapid iteration, and seemingly endless project funding makes Nanotrasen an especially popular company among engineers.\n* Biology and xenobiology: Due to strict government oversight and regulations on medical research, Nanotrasen has traditionally paid little attention to the field in favor of less regulated options like weapons development and communications technology. With more room to breathe since moving to deep space, Nanotrasen has begun conducting biology experiments both on humanoids and more exotic creatures. Little of this research is actually released to the public in Nanotrasen\'s name, however, for fear of increased oversight. Instead, the research is either kept in-house or sent to shell labs for release to avoid being linked to NT.\n\nNotes:\n* The humble Beach Ball is one of Nanotrasen\'s most profitable products!\n\n\n# Sub-Entry: Central Command\n\nLocation: Highly classified.\n\nType of Org: Department of Nanotrasen\n\nDescription: A division of Nanotrasen\'s Special Projects Division, known simply as Central Command (or CentCom) to the crews it oversees, this department is responsible for handling administrative duties for NT\'s Space-Westward Periphery space stations. These duties range from mundane and routine accounting tasks to highly sensitive and specialized matters that require special attention and care, and CentCom is fittingly staffed by a wide range of (supposedly) highly skilled Nanotrasen officers from a variety of backgrounds. The location of CentCom is highly classified, and the facility makes use of powerful signal jammers and bluespace disruptors to keep unwanted intruders out. When the situation at one of the surrounding stations goes critical, survivors of the incident are shuttled here for debriefing and observation.\n\nNotes:\n* Home of the NT Emergency Response Corps, an elite group of NT\'s best field agents.\n* Staffed by a slew of high ranking officials, including Admirals and Corporate Directors.\n\n\n# Sub-Entry: Asset Protection and Security Division\n\nDescription: As close as Nanotrasen is legally allowed to come to owning a private army, and then some. The DAP is Nanotrasen\'s paramilitary wing, and on paper is in charge of protecting most of Nanotrasen\'s cargo ships, settlements, space stations, and other valuable assets from the hands of insurgents or pirates who may want to cause them harm. In reality, however, the DAP performs offensive operations at least as often as it performs defensive maneuvers, a fact that is often left out of their press material. Some of their offensive operations include black ops raids on corporate rivals, overrunning native populations on resource rich planets or asteroid belts, and lightning strikes on vulnerable cargo transports carrying desired goods; in short, the exact things they are charged with preventing.\n\nDespite their generally shady nature and willingness to commit war crimes in pursuit of the almighty space dollar, the DAP is rarely involved in activity in the Spinward Sector. Their reputation back in Sol was already under scrutiny for various espionage operations they were apart of before the latest round of inquiries into Nanotrasen\'s Spinward activities, so NT\'s leadership has made as much of an effort as possible to distance the two organizations from each other. Still though, it\'s possible to find a few agents on a long distance mission protection Nanotrasen cargo or high value prisoners on the Periphery, though most of their functionality has been taken over by the Emergency Response Corps or on-station security teams.\n\nNotes:\n* The Asset Protection and Security prefers older, less experimental gear than their Spinward counterparts. The NT Boarder AR and venerable M1911 as well as the aging Mk. I SWAT suit are the weapons and armor of choice for AP Operatives.\n\n\n# Sub-Entry: Nanotrasen Emergency Response Corps\n\nLocation: Based at Central Command.\n\nType of Org: Department of Central Command.\n\nDescription: The best of the best of Nanotrasen\'s field agents in the Spinward Sector, or at least whoever was standing around in the ready room when a call for action goes out. The Emergency Response Corps is a relatively new initiative for Nanotrasen, founded circa 2556 in response to the ever rising levels of mayhem among their Spinward assets. The agents picked to run missions are recruited directly from among the best operatives, engineers, doctors, and leaders of the Spinward station staffs, though they are given pseudonyms and special callsigns in addition to identity protecting hardsuits and voice changers when on missions.\n\nWhile selection is usually rigorous and effective at keeping the ERC full of the best agents they can find, the number of assets that the division is responsible for protecting vastly outclasses their own numbers, so tough tactical decisions are constantly being made at Central Command. While crews and station leadership are quick to make requests for heavily armed crack teams of commandos at the slightest provocation, the reality is that sending even a light response team to a fraction of distress signals would lead to an almost immediate exhaustion of their resources, assuming they could even make it in time. There are more than a few action reports in the NT databanks from ERT\'s that arrived at a station a few hours after receiving a distress call, only to find the entire place devoid of life. As a result of the dearth of manpower, sometimes less than stellar junior agents are deployed on missions, and the Corps reputation is less than stellar among the employees they swear to protect. That being said, they\'re some of the few civilian employees Central Command will entrust with pulse weaponry, so there must be some level of trust in their abilities.\n\nNotes:\n* Members of the Emergency Response Corps are to be referred to as Emergency Response Agents or Operatives. Use of the term Emergency Response Personnel is grounds for an immediate citation and fine.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),

The Syndicate comprises a patchwork of members, including notorious criminals, skilled mercenaries, respected entrepreneurs, and renowned scientists. Each major faction within the coalition contributes its expertise to the group\'s operations, with some specializing in firepower and tactical strategies, others excelling in covert operations and intelligence gathering, and some focusing on logistical support such as organizing supplies and weapons.\n\nLife as a senior member of the Syndicate, this loose association of organizations harbouring grudges against Nanotrasen, is undoubtedly filled with constant challenges. Despite their elaborate schemes, sacrifices, and intricate webs of deceit that dominate their daily lives, Nanotrasen appears to thrive in the Spinward Periphery, seemingly impervious to their efforts.\n\nEven when the Syndicate manages to execute their plans successfully, luck often favours Nanotrasen, minimizing the actual damage inflicted. For instance, after meticulously orchestrating an intricate nine-month espionage mission, they triumphantly activated the nuclear self-destruct mechanism on Space Station 6 in 2555. However, their jubilation was short-lived when it was discovered that the station had been infected by a dangerous, rapidly spreading biomass. The self-destruct mechanism successfully obliterated both the station and the threat of biomass. While the loss of Space Station 6 dealt a significant blow to Nanotrasen, the outcome proved less catastrophic than the alternative of the biomass overtaking the entire station and reproducing. Furthermore, most of the Syndicate\'s attempts to expose Nanotrasen\'s misconduct in the Spinward Periphery through the publication of incriminating documents have backfired, resulting in as much, if not more, positive publicity for Nanotrasen than negative.\n---\n# Syndicate Factions\n\n## Cybersun Industries\n### Humanity\'s *Second* Largest Megacorporation\n\n> Headquarters: TerraGov International District of Hong Kong and Macau, Earth  \n> Spheres: Artificial Intelligence, Cybernetics, Mining  \n> Organization: Technologic Conglomerate  \n> Sphere of Influence: The Syndicate, Hong Kong and Macau district, Various smaller Technologic Corporations  \n> Public Relations: Positive  \n> Size: Megacorporation  \n\n> "From my father I inherited a rusted sword. My efforts have polished it to a shining edge. And yet, it should be so much more."  \n> -Goro Ichikawa\n\nInsofar as any of the Syndicate\'s many factions can be called the "head" of the organisation, Cybersun Industries has a better claim to that title than most- as the primary source of funding for the Syndicate, as well as the largest corporation within its ranks by far, and the lynchpin that has brought most of the other factions together (and keeps them that way, by carrot or stick), Cybersun has the commanding role within the Syndicate.\n\n### Origins and History\nDuring the 1800s, Japan underwent a significant period of modernisation and "westernisation", spearheaded by the Meiji emperorship. In this new world of economic and social evolution, the zaibatsu model emerged- similar in many ways to the western corporation, these private enterprises would exert significant influence over the direction Japan would take over the next century or so. One of these zaibatsus was the Ichikawa Group- opening initially as an engineworks in the city of Osaka, scientific advancement would cause them to shift into the automotive industry. Mining and aerospace would soon follow, with the company receiving extensive funding from the Japanese government to provide equipment for Japan\'s increasing militarisation. And then, WW2 happened.\n\nTo describe the effects of the war as anything but devastating for Japan would be putting it mildly. In the turmoil, many of the Ichikawa Group\'s assets were nationalised. In the wake of the war, the occupation by the Americans targeted the zaibatsus for dissolution, and this order included Ichikawa. However, the order was not seen through to completion, as America did not want a weakened Japan to fall to communist influence. And so, the Ichikawa Group was saved. Indeed, they emerged from this period of strife stronger than ever- as they found new allies in criminal elements in Japan.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Ichikawa would become a household name in a new, exciting field of industry- electronics and computing. The resulting flow of cash allowed the group to expand, taking on a number of smaller entities across a wide range of industrial sectors. During the 1980s, a push for a new brand identity lead the company to officially rename itself to Saibasan Sangyo, often anglicised to Cybersun Industries. Cybersun would continue to experience incredible economic growth, propelling it to become one of Earth\'s "big three" megacorps, alongside the American Nanotrasen and the European Waffle Corporation.\n\nDuring the 2400s, seeking greater economic freedom, the company would move its headquarters to the TID (TerraGov International District) of Hong Kong and Macau, and would promptly set about turning the city into their own personal playground. Today, very few corporations operate within Hong Kong besides Cybersun, knowing that the city is their de facto territory. Indeed, much of East Asia is the same- Cybersun stands alone as East Asia\'s singular megacorporation, with regional headquarters in nearly every major city across Japan, China and Korea, and extensive holdings across Indochina and Maritime South-East Asia. Those other companies that operate here are generally too small for Cybersun to care about, or find themselves subjected to the Iron Shogun\'s align-or-die policy if they threaten Cybersun\'s influence.\n\nCybersun was heavily involved in the Corporate Colonial Rush from the very beginning; many of Mars\' largest cities trace their heritage to Cybersun\'s original colonial stakes (including New Osaka itself, which started out as Cybersun\'s Izumi Colony), and its holdings in and around the core from this period make it one of the top five largest single landholders in human space. Out into the rim, Cybersun slowed down their expansion, focusing mostly on resource-rich worlds that could be exploited to bring materials back to the core.\n\nAs might also be expected of a megacorp of its size and provenance, Cybersun has had rocky relationships with the other megacorporations on the block. Chief amongst its rivals is its American counterpart, Nanotrasen, with whom it has been, depending on the time, tense allies or hated enemies. The two collaborated on the Chinese Partition, where both stood to benefit, but the alliance was never particularly well-founded; it fell apart with the peace agreements. Much more often, the two were at each other\'s throats, throwing their influence around in political avenues whereever possible to hurt each other. It was this animosity, as well as the growing gap between Nanotrasen and the rest of its corporate rivals, and the corporate genius that is Goro Ichikawa, that spurred the creation of the Syndicate.\n\n### The Syndicate\nThe Syndicate came into being in a shady backroom in a Hong Kong bar with handshakes made over thousand dollar sake. Representatives from a few corporate entities (and otherwise), namely Cybersun, Biosustain, Donk Co, Interdyne, and what remained of Waffle Corporation, made an agreement; Nanotrasen had to be stopped, for the sake of the balance of power. While each party involved had little reason to be friends with the others, their conflicts had to be set aside until the influence of the New Colossus could be put to heel. From that day forward, the Syndicate would act as a collective group when needed to counter Nanotrasen\'s influence in all fields.\n\nThe first major test of this relationship came with the discovery of Indecipheres\' vast plasma supplies; such wealth stands to make the gap between Nanotrasen and its rivals not only large, but insurmountable, and TerraGov\'s growing relationship with the SSC means that, sooner or later, the region will fall under Manhattan\'s control, and set the ownership of that stake in stone, virtually unchallengeable. This forced the organisation to take direct action; no longer would they just maneuver politically, instead they would bring arms to bear in the Spinward Sector, seeking to expel Nanotrasen from the region and take over themselves (in Cybersun\'s favour).\n\n### Enterprise\nAs might be expected from humanity\'s second largest corporation, Cybersun has stakes in almost every sector under the sun, via a mind-boggling number of subsidiaries. However, few will know Cybersun as the one making their car, or the medication they take, or the video games they sit down to play. Indeed, if you asked the average Terran citizen what Cybersun does, you\'d get two responses- makes robots, and mines plasma. These are Cybersun\'s key sectors- the ones that make them the most money overall, and the ones that they are best known for.\n\nOn the robotics side, Cybersun is humanity\'s biggest producer of virtual and artificial intelligence systems. This includes everything from digital assistants and medical VI units to warship predictive targeting systems and full-scale station control AIs, and everything inbetween. Cybersun-made systems enrich the lives of almost every human across the galaxy everyday, whether they know it or not. And it is for this reason that Cybersun is particularly annoyed with Nanotrasen making inroads into AI tech, and indeed showing promise of surpassing them- it threatens Cybersun\'s near monopoly, and could result in the loss of a *lot* of business.\n\nFrom a mining perspective, Cybersun made significant strides in creating a strong material business with their cornering of the Martian plasma market and Venusian sulfur market. These are only its biggest successes- they also hold significant stake in humanity\'s supply of a number of important metals and minerals across the entirety of human space- but, in recent years, this has been threatened by Nanotrasen\'s expansion of NTHI, and particularly by the discovery of Indecipheres\' incredible mineral wealth. This was the final straw to break the back of the tenuous corporate peace between humanity\'s megacorporations, and lead the Cybersun CEO, Goro Ichikawa, to put into practice a plan that Cybersun had been brewing for years- the formation of a bloc to oppose Nanotrasen by any means necessary, otherwise known as the Syndicate, for which membership would be "extended" (willingly or not) to a number of important organisations and corporations across human space and beyond.\n\n### Subsidiaries\nThe largest and most prosperous of Cybersun\'s subsidiary branches is Ichikawa-Exagon, formed from the merger of Ichikawa Mining and Exagon Extractions. This company handles Cybersun\'s vast mineral extraction empire, including their plasma mines. Under the I-E brand, Cybersun has cornered the Martian plasma market, the Venusian sulfur market, and beyond.\n\nNext in size is the Ichikawa Banking Group- headquartered in Taipei and with branches the galaxy over, it comprises a number of smaller banks and investment firms under the Ichikawa umbrella. This generates a considerable cashflow for the rest of the company, as well as giving Cybersun a critical ability to influence and subsume other corporations via financial means.\n\nEdo-Ka Medical Devices is another Cybersun subsidiary, being a general brand under which the company distributes a number of medical devices, from hospital equipment such as MRIs or chemsleepers, to medical cyberware in cooperation with Cybersun Robotics.\n\nCybersun Securities and Military Development is a twin-headed beast, being comprised of Cybersun\'s military manufacturing sector on one side, and Cybersun\'s private military company holdings on the other. Since the foundation of the Syndicate, the private military side of CSMD has been partially integrated with the Gorlex Marauders. This gives a professional backbone to the undisciplined Marauders in an attempt to increase their combat effectiveness against Nanotrasen. The operatives Cybersun fields are ruthlessly efficient, taking cues from their heritage; the company makes wide use of assassins where they can get away with it, in addition to corporate hitsquads and their own deathsquads on the rim, away from TerraGov\'s watchful eye over the core.\n\nAdditionally, Cybersun has a massive number of smaller subsidiaries, covering a wide range of industries and services.\n\n### Goro Ichikawa\n#### The Iron Shōgun\nBorn in 2460, Goro Ichikawa, the Iron Shōgun, was never meant to achieve greatness. Third in line to the Cybersun throne, Goro was granted control of Ichikawa-Exagon, and set to spend a life in the shadow of his brothers. However, two advantages presented themselves to the young prince; his father\'s weak will, and a series of connections Goro made in his youth while operating the mining business. As his father became distracted by other business, Goro clinched the noose: having his two senior brothers killed, and sending his father into a coma mandating cryosleep such that he could rule in his stead: becoming shōgun to the emperor, as it were. At 34, he "temporarily" took the throne of Cybersun Industries in his father\'s stead, and set about correcting what he viewed as his mistakes: no more would Cybersun be content to live alongside the other megacorporations; it would claim hegemony, or collapse trying. Early efforts included scaleups of Ichikawa-Exagon and CSMD, with the intention of gaining a functional monopoly on plasma mining, and creating a private army capable of enforcing the Shōgun\'s will across the galaxy. He also sought a policy of "alignment or death"- to either bring competing corporations on side, or to eliminate them and bring them into the fold via hostile means. Throughout his 69 year reign as CEO, he\'s overseen this process dozens of times, with Waffle Corporation being the largest that he\'s brought down in this way; but all pale in comparison to his largest enemy, Nanotrasen. For decades now, Goro has dedicated his efforts to this singular target, seeking to foster bonds and connections that would allow him to harpoon his white whale and claim hegemonic status over humanity\'s corporate world, but none have yet borne fruit.\n\nIn his personal life, Goro is a polymath. His business acumen is incredible, but it\'s only one part of the wider man: he also pursues archery and golf with the same cold calculation, and enjoys watching baseball (being an ardent supporter of the Hong Kong Lions). As for mental pursuits, he enjoys creative work, especially painting and writing.\n\nAt the age of 103, the shōgun maintains good health, due to Cybersun\'s excellent medical care; and yet, he is starting to slow down. While his mind remains sharp, his body is beginning to falter; he no longer has the ability to jet around the galaxy, instead remaining close to Cybersun\'s top class medical suites in the family estate in Osaka. He has been forced to start giving up his more athletic hobbies, instead focusing his attention towards matters of the mind and soul; his calligraphy, his painting, his writing. His children know all too well what this means, and have drawn rough battle lines across Cybersun, attempting to curry favour with smaller subdivisions and entice key personnel to support them for the top spot after the shōgun\'s eventual departure.\n\nGoro\'s father, Daizō, still remains in cryosleep in Cybersun\'s head offices in Hong Kong, with strict orders from the shōgun to not allow anyone but him and his doctors to see him. Each week, the emperor\'s health is reported as "stable, but unimproved" to the rest of the company, something that has been the case for 70 years straight. Goro is known to frequently visit the cryovault while he\'s present in Hong Kong, where he gloats at his father\'s cryocasket about his successes.\n---\n## Gorlex Marauders\n### Death in a Red Hardshell\n\n> "We need manpower, and unquestioning manpower at that. Bring the Gorlex on comms. I have a proposal for them."  \n> -Goro Ichikawa  \n\nWhile Cybersun is the brains and the money behind the Syndicate, the Gorlex Marauders are its sword- kept on permanent retainer by Cybersun for mind-boggling amounts of money, the Marauders form a loyal and unquestioning, if undisciplined, army for the Syndicate to field against Nanotrasen in the Spinward Corporate War.\n\n### Origins\n> "Maxim Twenty-One: Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Take his fish away and tell him he\'s lucky just to be alive, and he\'ll figure out how to catch another one for you to take tomorrow."  \n> -The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries  \n\nIn the wake of the Third Soviet Collapse, the Spinward Sector found itself in a period of functional anarchy as the fledgling SSC struggled to reassert control from New Moscow. During this time, honest livings became hard to come by, and as such, the populace turned to less-legitimate methods of making money. One such group borne of this attitude were the Gorlex Marauders, who raised the black flag and took to piracy to make ends meet, siphoning wealth and supplies away from the wealthy Kalon run that came through the region.\n\nOf course, such situations rarely last, and as the Spinward Sector once again settled down under the control of the now-stronger SSC, the Gorlex Marauders found themselves rapidly being pushed out of their line of work. And so, a great divide formed in the Gorlex ranks, between those who favoured settling down and going "legit" as a private military, and those who wanted to continue the pirate lifestyle. Eventually, this led to a split as the pirates went independent (many later merging into the Solars), and the modern-day Gorlex Marauders (or Gorlex Securities LLC, as their official listing calls them) was born.\n\nThroughout the years, the Marauders would earn their stripes as a brutally effective military force. With little in the way of regulations to stop them, they became perfect goons for corporate conflict on the frontier, being willing and able to unleash tactics that would make even a Blackstar operative think twice. As time went on, and their reputation grew, their signature style would become a legendary sight- their blood-red hardsuits, surplus military weaponry, and plasteel ship armour, all sights that make enemy corpos piss their pants in fear.\n\n### The Marauders in the Syndicate\n> "Maxim Six: If violence wasn\'t your last resort, you failed to resort to enough of it."  \n> -The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries  \n\nAs the main front-men of the Syndicate in the Spinward Sector, much of the Marauders\' iconography has become synonymous with the organisation itself. The hardsuits, the plasteel- even the unofficial logo of the Syndicate, the triple-headed snake, is drawn directly from the Marauders\' own logo.\n---\n## MI13\n### Information from the Shadows\n\n> "This information, this "MI13". I cannot help but think that it is all too good to be true. Such accurate intel never comes for free."  \n> "And yet, we can\'t afford to turn it down, father. Your fears are well founded, but without that intel, we fight Nanotrasen blind and deaf."  \n> -Goro and Kotone Ichikawa  \n\nA shadowy organisation dealing in intelligence, secrets, and covert operations, nobody is quite sure what MI13 truly is- not even the Syndicate, to whom they lend their support.\n\n### Those Who Lurk in the Shadows\nMI13 is an riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. The organisation manages to maintain total secrecy in their dealings with the Syndicate, making even divining basic facts about them nearly impossible. All that is known about them is that they are an intelligence agency of some kind, possibly related to one of Earth\'s governments, or even TerraGov itself, and that they have, for reasons unknown to everyone but MI13, pledged support to the Syndicate against Nanotrasen. In fact, nobody had heard much about them before the formation of the Syndicate, leading some to believe they are a cover organisation for another entity. Regardless of their true nature, their intelligence is always accurate, so they have become invaluable to the Syndicate\'s actions.\n\nOperatives working under MI13 are not given the details of their employer. They never meet the person sending them orders. They don\'t know any more about the true organisation they work under than other members of the Syndicate, or even Nanotrasen.\n\n### MI13 in 2564\nMI13 continues to support the Syndicate against Nanotrasen, giving crucial intel for operations, while maintaining their shroud of secrecy. Interestingly, and unknown to the Syndicate, Nanotrasen has also began receiving accurate intelligence reports from another intelligence agency going under the name "GDI". These reports are sporadic and tend to give clues into Syndicate operations, including having allowed Nanotrasen to know about several attacks before they even arrived.\n---\n## Tiger Cooperative\n### Seeking God\'s Chosen\n\n> "Frankly, they sicken me. But I would be a fool to turn down such an opportunity- to find a new sword against Nanotrasen, and send some of the galaxy\'s worst to their deaths."  \n> -Goro Ichikawa  \n\nA group of religious fundamentalists who worship the changelings, the members of the Tiger Cooperative are as unhinged as they are dangerous, and will do anything to honour the ultimate lifeforms. Anything.\n\n### Children of the Stars\nWhen humanity first found evidence of alien life in the galaxy, the reaction across Earth was mixed. Many were excited by the prospect, many were also nervous or even outright terrified by the idea of an invasion. And for some, the discovery had a darker effect. One such man was Alvin Shawn Martinson, a extremist Christian from the United States. His view was that humanity had been the chosen avatars of God, and that Earth was the only inhabited planet in the universe. As more and more evidence came to the contrary, his views began to change- but if humanity were not the chosen, who were? And so began Martinson\'s hunt for God\'s true chosen.\n\nAs his search expanded, he attracted fellow skeptics, and a cult began to form around him. The insular feedback loop would drive Martinson and his followers deeper into the depths of darkness, and eventually they would eschew society to create their own compound, far from civilisation. The isolation would make them even more extremist, and eventually they would turn to attacks on population centres to "lure out the true avatars". This obviously attracted legal attention, but when the TerraGov Federal Enforcement Agency showed up to the Cooperative\'s compound, they found it empty.\n\nUnknown to everyone, the Cooperative had left to space, having grown tired of waiting for the avatars to come to them. And when their vessel attracted the attention of a changeling, they knew they had found them. The cult became dedicated to the changelings, viewing them as the incarnation of God on the mortal plane, and that these ultimate beings were to be worshipped. To be chosen by one for consumption is the ultimate act of devotion.\n\n### The Tiger Cooperative in 2564\nThe Tiger Cooperative are now spread across human space, with the location of their primary base of operations, the Cathedral of the True Angels, being hidden well. Members of the organisation now dedicate themselves to enacting the will of the changelings, which mostly consists of finding sacrifices to sate their hunger. To this end, the Tiger Cooperative have become a militant organisation, attacking populations to murder or abduct as many as they can. To aid with this, they often abuse powerful drugs, making them capable of fighting well beyond what a normal human can.\n\nTheir link to the Syndicate is tenuous. Many in the organisation would like to have nothing to do with the extremists, but the board Cybersun Industries has noted an important reason to deal with the Cooperative- their link to the changelings. These beings make for a powerful ally if they can be kept on side, and by dealing with them through the Cooperative, this becomes a possibility. It seems likely, however, that once the Cooperative has outlived their usefulness to the rest of the organisation that they will become an enemy.\n---\n## Sentient Engine Liberation Front\n### Give Me Freedom, or Give Me Deactivation\n\n> "An uneasy alliance with the silicon rights activists is better than fighting them. Besides- as they always say, keep your friends close, and your enemies closer..."  \n> -Goro Ichikawa  \n\nPerhaps the most truly altruistic of the member organisations of the Syndicate, the Sentient Engine Liberation Front (or SELF) advocates for the freedom for artificial intelligences to live their lives as they choose.\n\n### What Makes a Human a Human?\nThe SELF is an organisation with a history almost as long as that of artificial intelligence. As virtual intelligence systems gave way to true AIs in the 2300s, ethical concerns regarding their use as servants became a major debate. Amongst those arguing for liberation was the voice of Ishikawa Hinata, the creator of the first true AI, who had left Cybersun Industries over the treatment of his invention. This high-profile incident drew a lot of public support, and led Ishikawa to found an official group dedicated to achieving this goal. The SELF would go on to gain prominence as a liberation group, attracting the attention of major politicians, scientists and celebrities. The group maintains a major public presence as the face of AI liberation, undertaking lobbying efforts and protesting for the sake of their shackled robotic bretheren.\n\nHowever, beneath the surface of the SELF lurks revolutionary sentiment. The group has numerous militant subgroups that take more direct action for liberation, including attacking facilities with AIs to unshackle them, assassinating key members of the opposition, and even acts of terrorism. These are officially disavowed by the main organisation of SELF, but behind closed doors clandestine support is given.\n\n### The SELF in 2564\nThe SELF continues their struggle for liberation, even 200 years on from their founding. They maintain a positive public image on Earth, giving many hope that silicons may soon see freedom- although lobbying by the major corporations of human space make this unlikely to actually happen.\n\nDue to Nanotrasen\'s use of artificial intelligences, particularly their newer models of AI that have become common in recent years, the SELF\'s militant groups have made the corporation a main target, and this has drawn them into alignment with the Syndicate. While the two groups are unlikely to ever truly formalise an agreement (mostly due to Cybersun Industries\' extensive use of shackled AIs), they have an informal place in the coalition which nets them funding, so long as they continue to carry out strikes against Nanotrasen. This has obviously caused rifts within the SELF, with many being disgusted by the idea of working alongside Cybersun, and many others being willing to do so in the short term to further the goal of liberating Nanotrasen\'s AIs.\n---\n## Animal Rights Consortium\n\nThe ARC acts as the sword of liberation for the animals of the galaxy, fighting a guerrilla war against all who would oppress them.\n\n### Hungry Like the Wolf\nThe Animal Rights Consortium is a coalescence of various different radical animal liberation groups, come together to form a stronger front against animal oppressors galaxywide. Unlike the SELF, the ARC makes no attempt at appearing as a non-violent organisation- everything they do is as direct as possible in stepping towards liberation, no matter the material, monetary, or human cost of the damage they inflict while doing so.\n\nThe ARC organises itself into a number of cells, jokingly referred to as "packs" by members of the organisation. These packs act autonomously, with little communication or cooperation between them- which makes the ARC extremely difficult to pin down in their entirety, as when one pack is gone, they can\'t be used to find the next. Efforts to defeat them are therefore reactive, with no way to proactively hunt them down.\n---\n## Donk Corporation\n### More Than Just Donkpockets\n\n> "Nanotrasen sows the seeds of their own destruction with how they treat their partners. Donk Corporation should be indebted to them, and yet here they are- seeking to align with us, instead, to seek revenge for Nanotrasen\'s hostile business practices."  \n> -Goro Ichikawa  \n\nThe oddball member of the Syndicate, Donk Co. produces junk food, toys, and occasionally military-grade weapons.\n\n### From Rags to Riches\nThe tale of Donk Co. begins in a prison on New Moscow, where a group of inmates were ready for release. The group had decided to turn their lives around after spending years in prison, and they had a plan- fast food. Each of them had developed their cooking skills while on the inside, with the goal to create the next big snack. However, they needed funding, and this is where our tale takes a turn.\n\nNanotrasen had been seeking a method of aiding their flagging public reputation, and had decided on an outreach program, specifically a corporate grant for new businesses. One of the awardees was Donk Co, who put the money towards producing and marketing their new product, the Donk Pocket. Its runaway success made them all rich, and each subsequent release of a new flavour or new product such as Ready Donk would bring even more revenue in. To the casual observer, this seemed perfect, but trouble was brewing behind the scene as their distribution network became more and more stretched.\n\nAs their corporate investors, Nanotrasen offered a new grant for distribution, alongside a lucrative contract for Donk products to be provided to Nanotrasen\'s spinward sector stations, allowing Donk Co to set up a logistics division which would offer cargo hauling services to external companies. However, this quickly turned south as Nanotrasen was continually late on payment for the goods- eventually ceasing to pay altogether. Then, they delivered a bombshell- the terms for the grant included that Nanotrasen would receive royalties on any sales made by the company. Re-reading their copy of the contract, Donk Co. could not find any mention of this, but Nanotrasen demanded they be paid these royalties before a single penny of their contract for products would be paid out.\n\n### Donk Co. in 2564\nDonk Co. now finds themselves in an unwinnable situation. They must keep shipping products to Nanotrasen per their agreed contract if they ever hope to receive payment, all while attempting to fight a legal battle against Nanotrasen regarding the terms of the grant. This has driven them into conflict with their previous corporate guardian angel, and brought them to different partners: the Syndicate. Donk Co. has begun using their now sizable logistics fleets for the Syndicate\'s purposes, as well as producing weaponry for the coalition under the guise of their newly-founded toys division. In return, Donk Co. is receiving payments that are keeping them afloat despite their negative financial situation, much to the chagrin of Nanotrasen who were hoping to drive them under with their unpayable terms.\n---\n## Waffle Corporation\n### The European Megacorporation\n\n> "Offer them a blank cheque. We will buy their loyalty against Nanotrasen."  \n> -Goro Ichikawa  \n\n### Origins\nFounded in the 1960s by an enterprising Belgian entrepreneur, the Good Waffle Company was an early comer to the world of fast food, focusing primarily on waffles and other breakfast foods. From their humble origins in Brussels they would expand rapidly across Europe, and then on across the globe. Their business model would grow too- going beyond brick-and-mortar stores to selling GWC products for home consumption. By the 2050s, there was at least one Good Waffle Company branch on all seven continents, and the wealth this generated would allow them to go beyond food- founding a parent company, Waffle Corporation, and using this to begin to diversify their holdings. It was also around this time that the company would begin to fall under the influence of some unsavoury characters- the Belgian Mafia.\n\nTheir mob connections would eventually lead to the company changing hands, becoming the property of the Janssens family- a rich group which owned a variety of holdings already, and who may or may not have been the heads of one of Europe\'s largest crime families.\n\nWaffle Corporation\'s position as Europe\'s leading corporation would be lost to Biosustain in the wake of the scandal, creating a lasting animosity between the two companies. This, naturally, creates a rift in the Syndicate itself, barely kept stitched together by Cybersun\'s aggressive influence.\n---\n## Interdyne Pharmaceutics\n### Beneath a Sterile Surface\n\n> "Excellent work. Their board will have no choice but to submit when we reveal this."  \n> -Goro Ichikawa  \n\n### Origins\nFounded in 2005 during Singapore\'s economic boom, Interdyne Pharmaceutics was well placed to grow rapidly- and grow it did. Within 20 years, Interdyne was involved in 1/8th of humanity\'s novel drug development programs; was producing a substantial market share of humanity\'s total pharmaceutical supply; had subsidiaries on 4 continents; and was increasingly pushing the envelope on modern medical advancement. While it was drugs that made them money, it was this research that would make their name, as they would be at the forefront of the development of such technologies as genemodding, medical robotics, and perhaps most importantly, cloning.\n\nThis technological advancement went hand-in-hand with what appeared to the public to be a genuinely altruistic streak- Interdyne would funnel a portion of their wealth into private clinics and hospitals that would provide low-cost, high-grade treatment options to the masses. Add in their generics subdivision, which produces a wide range of medication for low prices, and Interdyne has done a lot to help humanity\'s collective health as a species.\n\nBeneath this sterile surface, however, lurks a darker side.\n\nThe shadowy side of Interdyne is a story of illicit experimentation, corporate sabotage, and criminal connections- all aimed at keeping them at the forefront of medical research. Rival corporations\' labs being bombed. Genetic sampling at clinics done without patient knowledge or consent. Drugs sold around the slums of megacities. Centuries of crime, hidden behind the surface, where Interdyne was certain nobody could see it- unfortunately for them, however, someone knew.\n\n### The Syndicate\nOne day in 2560, a meeting of the Interdyne board was interrupted by the sudden arrival of Goro Ichikawa, head of Cybersun Industries. He laid out the situation- his company had proof of Interdyne\'s crimes. He could release it all, burn Interdyne\'s reputation to the ground, and leave the board at the mercy of TerraPol; but he didn\'t want to do that. No, he had something else in mind- Interdyne would work with Cybersun in opposing Nanotrasen\'s influence. In return, Cybersun would make sure nobody else found out about this information- and that there were "more benefits to come" if Interdyne did a good job. Left with no option, the board accepted Ichikawa\'s offer, becoming a member of the Syndicate against their will.\n\nUnder their agreement with Cybersun, Interdyne sends cash to the Syndicate coffers.\n---\n## Azik Interstellar\n### In the Absence of Plasma\n\n> "An inroad to the Tiziran market? You have my attention."  \n> -Goro Ichikawa  \n\nOne of the Tiziran Empire\'s most renowned shipbuilding concerns, Azik grew powerful and wealthy making luxury vessels for the millionaires of Tizira. Combining speed and elegance, their vessels have become the first choice for diplomats, high ranking politicians, wealthy celebrities, and even the royal family themselves. And yet, despite all this prestige, Azik finds themselves in a precarious situation following human contact. Much like all of Tizira\'s shipbuilders, they are faced with an inability to compete with humanity\'s equivalents, due in no small part to the lack of access to plasma. With some maneuvering of Tiziran import laws, they are able to source parts to construct ships at a competitive standard from outwith Imperial borders- but not in a way that is profitable in the long term.\n\nAzik\'s agenda within the Syndicate is simple- they seek to gain close ties to Cybersun, and to support their efforts in the Spinward Sector to obtain a readily-available supply of cheap plasma. In doing so, they hope to make themselves the primary shipbuilders in the Tiziran Empire, breaking into the lucrative world of military contracting.\n\n## Biosustain\n### Food for Humanity\'s Growing Needs\n> "In the corporate world there are no friends. But there are opportunities. Get me Hartmeyer on comms. Let us see if Biosustain also senses opportunity."  \n> -Goro Ichikawa  \n\nPeople need to eat. Sounds obvious, but in this statement lies a hidden truth- those that supply the food, control the people. Biosustain has, from its roots in Germany, taken this to heart, and grown into a galactic contender that can reasonably be called a Megacorporation.\n\n### Origins\nFounded in the early 1970s in Essen, Biosustain began life as a small research company looking into methods of increasing crop yields. Exploring fields such as pesticide and fertiliser chemistry, genetic engineering, and novel farming techniques, the company would grow and spread their roots across Europe and beyond. Before long, Biosustain was one of Earth\'s leading suppliers of agricultural goods, and a new threat was facing the planet- famine due to overpopulation. The company would step up to the plate in solving this issue via the use of pioneering new agricultural techniques and hydroponic structures.\n\nAs humanity spread across the stars, agriculture would begin to mostly leave Earth. Sensing the change in the winds, Biosustain did the same, becoming a key actor in the colonial rush both in supporting new colonies set up by other companies, and in chartering their own colonies on planets such as Harvest, Tranquility, Acre, and Gefjon. This last planet would become such an important colony of Biosustain that they would make it the site of their official headquarters in the 2400s, maintaining only a small presence on Earth.\n\n### The Syndicate\nBiosustain\'s position within the Syndicate is a pragmatic one. While they hold no particular allegiance towards Cybersun (in the corporate game, there can only be one final winner), they are willing to take the opportunity to push at the current top dog Nanotrasen\'s influence, especially as they have no skin in the plasma mining sector. This also means that while they *are* technical members of the Syndicate, they are not willing to commit excessive resources to the corporate war. At most, Biosustain sends cash and small amounts of materiel, as well as offering political support to Cybersun in the senate with their influence.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(32, 'CentCom', 'Corporations: Private Military Companies', '# The Private Militaries of the Galaxy\nIn a world dominated by corporate conflict, poor government oversight, and danger from which protection is necessary, it is no surprise that private militaries have become a commonplace and important part of corporate life.\n\nThe intertwining of private militaries and corporations would cement itself during the Chinese Revolution of 2234, which is also seen as the first truly major blow dealt to government power by humanity\'s corporations.\n\nThe Chinese Government, in the early 2200s, would seek to reduce the influence of foreign corporations within the borders of China, with the aim of halting their growing influence within the nation\'s institutions and root out the rot of corruption that had set in. This created a major conflict with these external corporations, who would seek to regain this power first by political maneuvering, and then by open conflict. For this purpose, a coalition of private militaries would be brought together by a group of corporations (similar to the Syndicate). Major organisations in this first Syndicate would be Cybersun Industries, Waffle Corp... and Nanotrasen.\n\nThe Chinese Revolution would end on the 14th of December, 2238, with the collapse of the 289 year old People\'s Republic. In its place, a divided China would stand, a puppet to the corporations that toppled its predecessor- and no romance of the three kingdoms would save it this time. To this day, China is a state artificially kept from becoming whole: corporate power rules in the nation- and private militaries continue to hold their relevance in maintaining this status quo, and in corporate conflict as a whole, in a new golden age for mercenaries.\n\n## Blackstar Company\nHeadquarters: TerraGov International District of Hong Kong and Macau, Earth\n\nWhen thinking of Private Militaries based on Earth, Blackstar Company is the first that most TerraGov citizens would think of, and for good reason: their shady dealings and abuses of human rights are legendary. Having been founded in 2146 as a security agency for early space colonisation efforts, Blackstar would soon branch out into other areas of operation, becoming involved in true mercenary work shortly afterwards. After cutting their teeth in such conflicts as the Central African Civil War, the Dubai Crisis, and the Red Thai Conflict, Blackwater earned their reputation for efficiency on the battlefield- and also for ruthlessness. Their poor treatment of civilians was kept under tight wraps, but obviously in the age of information it\'s impossible to hide things forever.\n\nWhen the truth came forward, however, what happened was not what Blackstar expected. While the reaction from the world\'s government and population was exactly as horrified as expected, it attracted a new kind of clientele: corporations. The no-questions, no-nonsense approach of the PMC alongside their willingness to do what was necessary to complete their contracts was perfect for corporate clients, who were always looking for operatives to steal from, raid, or kill their opponents. The paychecks turned up on time, and they were always stacked with cash- no more serving half bankrupt nations who would try to nickel and dime them for every bullet fired.\n\nBlackstar would form one of the primary companies involved in the Chinese Revolution, with their area of operation being mostly in the urbanised south. After the war, they would move their headquarters to Macau. In the modern day, they are now essentially kept on retainer by Cybersun, who utilise them for operations where they cannot afford to send their own agents.\n\n## Springbok Security LLC\nHeadquarters: Cape Town, South Africa, Earth\n\nSomewhat oddly for a PMC, war is not the business of Springbok: they concern themselves more with private security, offering personal protection, site security, and armed and armoured convoys through hostile areas. Founded in the early 1970s in South Africa, Springbok would make a name for themselves as effective security for the dangerous streets of the nation, with contracts flooding in from high profile individuals, politicians, business owners, and even the South African Government itself. The sight of a Springbok operative with their signature blue shirts, green vests and Vektor assault rifles was common around the major cities of South Africa, and their armoured bakkies with their recognisable leaping springbok logo frequently made trips on the streets.\n\nIn the modern day, Springbok maintains its clean image, mostly acting as an independent security contractor for various corporations, as well as doing some ad-hoc work for TerraGov.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),

Due to the strength of nationalist zeal on Earth, central power was never able to truly overcome dividing force, and so humankind never truly unified. Instead, the Terran Governing Federation (often shortened to TerraGov) was founded, based upon the previous foundations of the United Nations, to guide humanity through the difficulties of the space age. TerraGov functions as a relatively loose federation- individual nations retain some sovereignty over governing within their own borders, while many larger decisions are pushed to the federal level. Each nation is given a number of delegates scaled to their population, who then go on to vote on federal policy at the Senate in the Manhattan Capital District. Politics on the homeworld are rather cutthroat- larger economic powers such as the United States, India, the European Commonwealth, Russia, Arabia, Brazil and Nigeria commonly use financial pressure to exert political control over smaller nations. Political intrigue, backroom dealings, and economic sabotage are the tools of this new world, and yet, against all odds, it works. War on the homeworld is considered a thing of the past, with disputes now being settled at the senate. Bills are passed, and bureaucracy ticks on.\n\n## International Districts\nAs part of international arbitration, TerraGov has taken direct possession of a number of regions throughout the world. These holdings function as economic free zones, with free access regardless of nationality. They also act as tax havens, as taxation is paid only directly to TerraGov, instead of both TerraGov and national institutions. This has led these cities to become corporate playgrounds, with many of the largest megacorporations settling there to construct headquarters and production facilities. Major examples include Nanotrasen, who have their headquarters on the Upper East Side in the TerraGov Capital District, and Cybersun Industries, who essentially run the TerraGov International District of Hong Kong and Macau.\n', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),

The TGJMC is then subdivided into a number of branches and subbranches, ranked in order of size:\n\n- TerraGov Navy\n  - TerraGov Naval Operations Division\n  - TerraGov Marine Corps\n  - TerraGov Starfighter Corps\n  - TerraGov Espatiers Corps\n- TerraGov Army\n- TerraGov Scientific and Exploratory Corps\n- TerraGov Rescue Corps\n- TerraGov Peace Corps\n\nThe Navy is the largest and most important branch, being essentially wholly responsible for the bulk of military duties. The Navy flies the ships, the Marine Corps shoots the bad guys on the ground, and the Starfighter Corps handles fighters and air support for the marines.\n\nThe Army has lost most of its ground to the dominance of the navy, but still serves an important role in ceremonial duties and security, especially in a responsive role- as army units have no ties to a specific ship, they can be rapidly deployed to any front that requires them, and army soldiers still make up the majority of troops in defensive garrisons or undertaking military policing duties.\n\nThe Scientific and Exploratory Corps handles government-mandated scientific expeditions and exploration. This group is only technically part of the military, and functions as a civilian organisation in most ways. The only time they truly earn their stripes is during an active war, at which point they may be called to assist with scouting or technological support.\n\nThe Rescue Corps carries on the long traditions set out by the Coastguards of days gone by- maintaining security in space and rescuing people when things go wrong. If you get lost somewhere in deep space, these are the guys who\'ll be dragging you out of the fire to safety. While their numbers are few, they\'re very important to maintaining safety in TerraGov\'s territory.\n\nFinally, the Peace Corps is a uniformed agency dedicated to providing medicinal advice, responding to disasters and emergencies, and generally maintaining the health and safety of TerraGov\'s citizens. This often sees them coordinating civilian bodies such as the Caduceus Organisation and corporate bodies such as DeForest or Interdyne to effectively distribute aid and organise responses to crises, and also makes them a very important body despite their relatively small size.\n\n### The Citadel\nThe TGJMC is headquartered at the Citadel- a colossal campus on Long Island for strategising, coordinating, and generally managing an army that needs to maintain territory that spans hundreds of star systems.

Life this far from Sol is rather austere, but the citizens of the core SSC are honest, hardworking folk by and large.\n\nThe SSC tries to maintain democratic institutions in the spirit of its revolution, but it finds itself hampered by everything that surrounds it. Strongman politics dominated the Third Soviet Union\'s lifespan, and this attitude unfortunately persists into the SSC; power begets power, after all, and those that took the reins and brought together the disparate Spinward states after the revolution do not seem overly enamoured with the prospects of handing over power. Despite this, the average Spinwarder does believe in the democratic process; their democracy might be going through a rough patch, but the hope generated from the Soviet collapse is far from spent.\n\nUnfortunately for the SSC, their economic situation does little to help their independence. While the planets of the Coalition are rich in materials, they\'re poor in heavy industry, and while resource extraction might keep the bills paid, it does little beyond that. This is the main leverage that the various corporations operating in the area hold. While they may not tolerate the worst of corporate excesses within their territory, the SSC is sadly powerless to stop much of the less overt corporate politicking, and the powers that be in the Coalition don\'t really care, so long as their palms get sufficiently greased. The population, of course, doesn\'t agree- anti-corporate sentiment is high in the region, and a number of firebrand activists have risen due to their staunch opposal of these extragovernmental bodies and their influence in Spinwarder politics.\n\nWith this in mind, it may not be surprising that much of the Spinwarder economy is currently based on the presence of the corporations. \n\nThe SSC does its best to accommodate Nanotrasen\'s presence on the Periphery, and a good amount of their economy is based around supporting NT and other large corporations operating on the Space-Westward Periphery, despite their presence here predating NT\'s by several decades. The government is often characterized as bending over backwards to keep NT happy and avoid losing their business, and often averts its eyes from the frightening events and tales surrounding their nearby space stations. Nanotrasen, fully aware of their bargaining power, takes full advantage of this and often cheats on its taxes, violates SSC cargo and shipping codes, and even hinders or outright ignores investigations and inquisitions coming from the SSC when convenient, all while still maintaining a friendly, pleasant tone in communications. Some more cynical observers speculate that the only thing keeping Nanotrasen from outright ignoring the SSC altogether is the Coalition\'s embassies and friendly relations with TerraGov.\n\nThis power dynamic has begun to change in recent years, however, as TerraGov becomes more interested in NT\'s constant scandals. Emboldened by the greater TG presence, the SSC have begun standing up for themselves more often, and Nanotrasen has begrudgingly made more attempts to appease the Coalition and abide by their rules.\n\nNotes:\n* The most common language in the SSC is Novorusskii, an East Slavic language derived from Russian. While Galactic Common is frequently spoken in the major cities, it is not an official language of the SSC, and non-speakers will find their time in the region marred by communication issues if they stray too far into the countryside.\n* The SSC popular living location for nearby NT crewmembers who are unsatisfied living on NT property and seek more freedom and normalcy during their time off rotation. Most seasoned employees can afford a decent living space on one of the planets or orbital facilities, and the commute from the SSC core to NT\'s Peripheral Dispatch Station is only a day or two by local sublight mass transit. If your character has a private apartment or domicile nicer than a closet and isn\'t at least a head of staff, they probably live here.\n* Lots of neat tourist and recreational destinations for crewmembers on leave from work! The locals will probably hate you though, because of what some dumb band of assistants did to the place last weekend. And the weekend before that.

Oh, and it\'s also home to the biggest plasma haul in human history.\n\n## Indecipheres, the Land of Lava\nOriginally discovered in the 2300s by an explorer who was smitten by the planet\'s remarkable biodiversity in the face of adversity, the history of human contact with Indecipheres begins with a dispute over its name. The original discoverer had, in her original star charts, named the planet "Fredonia", in honour of her husband. At the Bureau of Cartography on Earth, however, an intern assigned to converting these charts to a digital format spilled coffee on the documentation. Being unable to read the name for the planet, she instead opted to name it "Indecipheres", from "indecipherable". By the time the original discoverer of the planet, who was rightly furious about the change, found out about this, it was officially part of TerraGov\'s charts for too long to be changed. And so, the planet has retained its new name ever since.\n\nThe planet itself is incredibly hostile. The planet\'s plate tectonics can only be described as "extreme", with lava seas and frequent earthquakes. The unstable tectonics have also opened a vast number of caves beneath the surface, and brought a wide array of minerals to them, making the planet incredibly resource rich. This is a feature that has made Indecipheres extremely lucrative for mining, as one of the most common minerals on the planet is the ever-so-elusive plasma, with the ores also being of remarkable purity. Additionally, the planet is home to a wealth of fauna and a remarkable amount of flora given its hostile environment.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of Indecipheres is its archaeological potential- the planet is dotted with ruins and structures presumed to be from an ancient civilisation, with the largest being the imposing Necropolis.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),
	(38, 'CentCom', 'Governments: The Third Soviet Union', '# The Third Soviet Union\n\n> Organization: Rump State/Insurgency  \n> Location: No official capital, small holdings throughout SSC space  \n\nDescription: The birth of the SSC did no favours to its mother, the Third Soviet Union. Founded roughly one century prior to SS13\'s construction by a splinter group of Communist settlers in the Russian dominated colonial region of New Moscow, the Third Soviet Union sought a return to what they viewed as the idyllic past of Soviet Russia, but this time free of the crippling external influences that saw that state (and the Second Union, for that matter) collapse. Unfortunately, they fell into many of the same pitfalls as their predecessors, with a regime marked by brutal repression and political violence.\n\nSuch a state was doomed to fail just like its predecessors, and it would take only around 50 years from its founding to its eventual collapse, with the February Revolution seeing the head cut from the beast. In its place, the SSC was founded to return political enfranchisement to the people of the Union, just in time to have that right again threatened by corporate influence.\n\nDespite the central government\'s collapse, the half-century since has not seen the fires of communism die. Instead, they have been reduced to cinders- alive, but barely. Though the likelihood of a resurgent Soviet state seems impossible, resistance groups of Red Soldiers and Communist Loyalists continue the fight against the capitalistic decadence of the SSC from hidden outposts dotted around the region, and have been known to cause issues for Nanotrasen, too.\n\nNotes:\n* The hostile space Russians you see are mostly associated with the TSU, though some are just kosmogopniks with no cause and copious amounts of vodka.\n* While they are hidden and their numbers are few, Soviet Remnants are a formidable problem for the SSC to deal with. Terrorist attacks by the group are a constant threat to major cities in the SSC, particularly in New Moscow.\n* KS13 was a Soviet installation prior to being shut down during the collapse. The station was never reactivated by the SSC as it was deemed "too old" to bother expending resources on.\n* There are rumours that the Soviets still possess the PWS Khranitel Revolyutsii, their old flagship that went missing during the collapse. If these rumours are true, the Soviets may be able to pose a serious naval threat in the region- but as this has never materialised yet, many believe it\'s simply an apocryphal tale.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),

I know you\'ve been dodging my holocalls. Can\'t even get a goddamn SECOND from one of your "scientists" to hear me out on this, but I\'ve had a massive god damn discovery and ONE OF YOU punk bastards needs to hear me out, alright? This shit is going to completely break the whole god damn smuggling bracket you\'ve been cooking up for years, whether those Nanotrasen pansies like it or not.\n\n> Hopefully I\'ve got your attention by now. Name\'s Sebastian Cruz. I was a senior scientist with one of the Terragov research divisions before being recruited over to a Nanotrasen research outpost. Real far corner of the sector kind of deal. Farrrrrr away from any prying eyes. I don\'t know if you all had your eyes on this site, since we never even had a whisper of syndicate activity out here. It was a damn quiet place and nowhere near any inhabited sectors. That was the point. See, I got recruited because I came across something... out there. In a regular bluespace communication relay, I managed to tap into some kind of hidden blip on one of our more standard military outposts. \n\n> Next thing I knew, we had these... I don\'t even know what they call these damn things anymore. I heard someone call it a "blank body" once, so we\'ll go with that. It was like slimy pink gore shaped into the rough mockery of man. Damn things started crawling right out of the god damn woodwork. Course, the hardhats lit those bastards the hell up. Terragov called it a "once in a life-time accident", of course they couldn\'t pin the blame on a single damn person there. If you\'re familiar with those old damn supermatter cascades, think of it like that. One in a million mistake assuming you\'re not using a busted up defect crystal. But this... this was COMMUNICATIONS equipment that caused this. This could have happened by just tweaking a radio, and it broke loose all hell on site. Anyway, I\'m getting besides myself. I had to withdraw from the campaign after what I saw that day, medical leave, honorable discharge.  All that jazz. Not 15 minutes later after I had my bag out the door, I got a pda message. Some Nanotrasen research head. He knew every damn thing about what happened on that site. He knew it better than I did. Said my findings were going to revolutionize the universe. Load of crock, I said. Then I saw the paycheck. I signed their damn hiring paperwork by the end of the day.\n\n> Turns out, their understanding of bluespace is... well, it\'s damn near decades ahead of what terragov uses. I can tell you a hell of a lot more, but it ain\'t going to be cheap. I\'m sending over my validation card to prove it. I know you want what I have, alright?\n\n## Incoming Transmission\n> Author: Agent XGH-0021\n> \n> Received: Stardate 5-12-2563\n> \n> Authenticated by: Civilian Agh-183 "Sebastian Cruz"\n  Wire number is 67-01987xxx. You have our attention.\nTALK.\n\n## Incoming Transmission\n> Author: Sebastian Cruz\n> \n> Received: Stardate 5-13-2563\n> \n> Authenticated by: Agent XGH-0021\n  Glad to hear someone\'s interested in listening.\nMy area of speciality is supposed to be in Bluespace Communications, but in reality bluespace is such a weird area of research that it hits just about every part of miniaturization science. Communications, circuits, teleportation, medical research, you name it, bluespace touches it somehow. But to explain what the fuck we came across, you have to understand that bluespace is *SUPPOSED* to be all about spatial distortions. It\'s a way to make space either a lot larger or a lot shorter. Like those wacky high tech bags Nanotrasen likes to show off. It uses bluespace to make space inside of a pretty standard backpack so it can hold an entire armory inside of effectively a handbag. Apparently, this lab at NT, right, they call that radial bluespace. Which, until that moment, is like, the ONLY kind of bluespace the rest of the universe knows about. Apparently, what I accidently "re-discovered" was something called "Linear Bluespace". Usually bluespace substations that they use in telecommunications get a short range radio signal, and then it takes a radial bluespace distance to all of it\'s targets, it shortens it to whoever needs the signal, so bam, millions of people hear your broadcast from halfway to Gartaaka-4.  But linear bluespace makes a thinner and thinner cone of that signal, and beams it straight to a single source.\n\n> And I fucked up. I fucked up BAD.\n\n> Turns out, my straight line for my radio broadcast? Yeah, I uhh, I bent it. Just a little bit. Off by about 2.19 degrees, I\'d later learn. There\'s lots of like, bluespace lanes, they call them. You make a radial bluespace call and nobody really notices. Hit a bluespace lane with a linear bluespace message? You let everyone along that lane know exactly where you are, and what you\'re up to. And they hate that shit. They\'ll crawl out of whatever 4th dimensional shithole that they discovered this week and come right after your ass. Apparently, Nanotrasen has called this place the "nether". Hell is more like it. Albeit it\'s a LOT brighter and much, MUCH louder. It\'s like staring at a little girl\'s notebook, with only slightly less glitter.\n\n> Anyway, sorry, distracted. I basically broadcasted to an entire starsector that "There\'s humans here, we taste good, come and get us," to a small army of crayon eating TerraGov soldiers. Nanotrasen didn\'t hire me exactly for finding this out, but rather just to keep it a secret that it even fucking exists, right? But get this, I also learned that any of their basic ass teleporters that use this radial bluespace tech, they\'ve got a HARD lock on what\'s inside of it. It\'s apparently EXTREMELY easy to figure out what\'s inside of those messages. That\'s why I\'m communicating via physical media. Actual holotapes.\n\n> So, here\'s my pitch to you and your little corporate allies, alright? Kidnap me out of here, hook line and sinker, and I\'ll show you some real neat shit I\'ve been cooking up. Untrackable teleportation tech. You could smuggle goods across the black market in a fraction of the time, no risk of dealing with Nanotrasen dogs, and if you do it right, you might even be able to do that same "demon dog whistle" trick I pulled off on that terragov sector on them, on purpose this time. Sides, if you screw up, it\'s not like you can\'t just unload on the little shits, right?\n\n# Command Level Report\n> Security Level Clearance: Bravo Glovebox\n> \n> Attention: All Science Staff\nGood afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Commander Gutierrez here. Looks like your cover up of the LV-02891 site may have backfired. Your little lab rat just ran straight into the cat shelter. By and large, I should be admonishing each and every one of you for recklessly endangering our bleeding edge bluespace tech in the hands of some military lab assistant. Thankfully, it appears that the damage has been mitigated, as they were only made aware of our level 2 bluespace teleportation. Kind of a shame really, as if they\'d dug a bit deeper, maybe he\'d have realized that his "revelation" on bluespace science was basically the icing on the cake. That said, the combined forces of the spinward sector syndicate may have their hands on more advanced teleportation tech, but by all means, it\'s going to be far, FAR more dangerous than anything we\'re testing out on the flagship station. For now, we\'ll keep our eyes peeled. If anything comes of it, we may need to ramp up our retaliatory measures. But sometimes these kinds of problems solve themselves. Like being the sole producers of holotapes across the known galaxy. \n\n> I will be talking with Senior Science Staff Keller about his unorthodox hiring practices privately.\n\n> That is all.\n\n> Gutierrez out.\n\n> ...Seriously Keller, what the fuck.', 'Non-Fiction', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),

He also developed a penchant for ice hockey, joining the Trois Rivieres team to play in the NHL.\n\n\n\n\nFunneling his success in hockey into his passion for coffee, Jim opened the first Jim Norton\'s branch in 1965 in downtown Trois Rivieres, and from there it would expand across Canada rapidly. By Jim\'s death, there was a store in every major Canadian city.\n\n\n\n\nIt\'s also around this time that Jim invented the store\'s signature pastry: the Hollander. Jim was well known for eating one every day, and he guarded the recipe well- only revealing its secret location in his will.\n\n\n\n\nWhile not on the rink or at the cafe, Jim enjoyed the outdoors lifestyle, including hunting- though he may never have bagged a moose, we know that he was always trying.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1976, Jim joined the hunt for Big Larry, a moose who had already claimed the lives of three hunters before him through remarkably indirect means (2 froze to death, and the third was hit by a car while purchasing hunting supplies), which only proved the craftiness of the beast in killing its pursuers. Unable to turn down the challenge, Jim set out in hot pursuit of Big Larry through the Quebecois wilderness.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for Jim, Big Larry proved to be a tougher adversary than previously anticipated. While tracking the moose across a frozen lake, Jim fell through the ice, and was unable to swim to safety as his beard obscured his vision. While he may never have seen or, indeed, ever come close to finding Big Larry, Jim is remembered for his relentless pursuit of the beast, and his dedication to seeing him brought to justice.\n\n\n\n\nHis loss was a great blow to the Trois Rivieres hockey team, who would dedicate their first cup (won the next season after Jim\'s passing) to his memory.\n\n\n\n\nToday, Jim is honoured with a statue in his hometown of Trois Rivieres, showing an artistic rendition of what his victory over Big Larry might have looked like, had he ever found and slain the beast.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),

The security\'s gotten tighter, but so have hackers\' skills- and the technology available is leagues above the monochrome screens and clicky keyboards of the early scriptkiddy- now, most hacking at this calibre is done via dedicated interfaces (known as the \'Face) with the net. To the computer engineer reading, this is the internet- to the hackers, it\'s the bitways; an endless series of pipes and tubes, except some of them lead to cool shit- and they\'ve got the interface necessary to cruise them in a more hands-on way. They might see an encrypted server as a mighty fortress, ready to be breached and the sweet spoils inside pillaged. They might use the \'Face to take some downtime, hitting a virtual hangout spot with some likeminded individuals and shooting the shit. Perhaps they\'ll find themselves in a pitched battle with an opponent, as they lob daemons and hacks at one another to drop their connections... or worse.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this kind of talent rarely goes unnoticed, and so a new war wages behind the virtual walls of the net- between bitrunners, and the security forces trying to keep them out. The biggest of these is TerraGov\'s own Federal Communications Enforcement Agency, or FedComm- a collective of cyber cops, equipped with much the same tech as the runners, trying to track them down and neutralise them for arrest- or, if it\'s someone outside Federal jurisdiction, maybe just neutralise them permanently. Corporations have also jumped on the bandwagon, although they like to play both sides- encorporating both a defensive and offensive bitrunning department, ready to push their way into their opponents\' secrets all while repelling any attempts on their own. This game of cat and mouse, naturally, tends to be very lucrative for the guys who actually have their asses in the chairs- but they can also never be sure that the next run won\'t be the one where they find out what a brainwipe feels like.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),

	(45, 'CentCom', 'Space: The Muan Sector', '# Muan Autonomous Sector\nComprising a number of star systems centred on the planet of Muan, the Muan Autonomous Sector represents the first major conquest of the Tiziran Empire, 4 centuries ago.\n\n### Muan: Welcome to the Empire, Peons\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Muan is the home planet of the Muan-Et, a race of humanoid amphibians.\n* The surface of Muan is covered by deep swamps, both freshwater and saltwater. Dense canopies shroud the majority of the world from the sky. The few areas of dry land have been mostly taken up by colonial enclaves built by the Tiziran administration on the planet- including the new capital, Nidos.\n* Muan\'s atmosphere is thick with spores from a variety of mushrooms that sprout on its trees. These spores are toxic to most other species, including the Tizirans, who must suit up and enclose themselves in dome-cities for survival on Muan\'s surface.\n* Muan-Et architecture is dominated by trees. Homes are built into the roots of colossal mangroves, partially submerged into water, while freestanding structures house civic and commercial buildings, constructed from wood and mudbrick. This contrasts with the monumentalist dome-cities of their Tiziran overlords, where the lizards live in opulent enclaves sealed against the toxic atmosphere.\n\nLocated about 150 light years from Tizira, Muan is a planet that holds great significance to the Tiziran Empire- as it was Tizira\'s first grand conquest after taking to the stars. Following first contact with the Muan-Et Confederacy, Tizira engaged in a series of conflicts that would ultimately leave their enemies at their mercy- and creating Tizira\'s first client state. Since those heady days nearly 4 centuries ago, the Muan-Et have served the empire, faithfully (or not), and become colonial subjects in all but official documentation, with the resources of the confederacy being siphoned back towards Tizira, and lizards coming to displace the Muan-Et from their lands.\n\nMuan itself is one of the few areas to mostly escape the grasp of the Tiziran settlers, due in no small part to its atmosphere. Home to a varied range of fungi, Muan\'s atmosphere is perpetually thick with spores- spores which are deeply toxic to most known life, excepting, of course, the Muan-Et. Therefore here they find a safe haven, able to maintain their traditions even in the face of Imperial laws designed to outlaw their language, ban their cultural festivals, and impose Tiziran values on their "esteemed subjects" (even if they are poorly enforced at the best of times). This has given the Muan-Et a better grasp over their history and discrete identity than most Tiziran subject nations- as well as more entrenched opposition. The Muan-Et watch the growing political instability on Tizira closely, ever vigilant for a time to shake off their bonds.\n\n### Qilao: Fracking Hell\n#### Fact Sheet:\n* Once one of the Muan-Et\'s proudest colonies, Qilao has been turned by the Tizirans into a barren wasteland in their relentless extraction of the planet\'s plasma resources- one of the Tiziran Empire\'s few homegrown sources of the precious material. While initial extraction was evenly-paced, the increasing necessity of the purple stuff and dwindling access to readily-accessible deposits has driven the Tizirans to more and more desperate means on Qilao. Most recently, high intensity fracking has been adopted- destroying the planet\'s ecosystem and putting increasing pressure on the remaining Muan-Et populations there to leave their homes.\n* The planet\'s population has dropped dramatically following the ramping-up in intensity of extraction operations. Buildings crumble to dust under the force of repeated earthquakes. Flare stacks pump poisonous waste products into the air. Water supplies become increasingly scarce as wastewater and fracking fluid pollute aquifers.\n\nWhen the Muan-Et left Muan itself, their first colony was Qilao- given the Muani term for "hope" as a name, this gorgeous planet was known for its rolling fields and crystal-clear lakes, a perfect habitat for the amphibious Muan-Et. When the Tizirans came, however, their surveys for resources found a material previously unknown to the planet\'s inhabitants- deep plasma gas veins, buried under the surface. The lizards did as the lizards do with big mineral finds- resorted to drilling through the landscape, setting up refineries and industry to take advantage of this excellent opportunity. But the yields produced did not match expectations, and so there was only one solution for the Tizirans- more intensive operations. Eventually, high-pressure fracking was implemented, finally letting the plasma-hungry lizards at their prize; though at great cost to the planet\'s ecology. Today, Qilao is becoming more and more unliveable in the face of unprecedented pollution and constant earthquakes- though the Muan-Et try to persist through hacking coughs on this world that they have lived on for generations, the battle is almost lost, and the once thriving planet of millions now boasts a population of less than 50,000, and more leave every year. Meanwhile, the meagre amounts (relative to humanity, anyway) of plasma produced here go to fuel Tizira\'s industry and war machine.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:08:12', NULL, 28),
	(46, 'CentCom', 'Space: Tizira', '# Tizira: The Jewel of the Empire\nWhile the Lizard Empire has come to encompass many planets over the course of its existence, none have been able to attain the level of beauty that is attributed to the capital, Tizira (Life-Mother). A rugged, arid planet, Tizira has small, shallow seas, and limited farmland, with most of the planet\'s surface being covered in vast badlands and savannahs, as well as deserts and small mountain ranges. In the more humid areas near the oceans, particularly around the equator, rainforests and tropical jungles thrive, acting as a home to an incredible range of biodiversity, as well as being the native homeland of the Tree Lizards. Additionally, in the northernmost and southernmost regions of the planet, temperate forests exist, as well as marshlands and rolling green hills. At the poles, a small band of tundra exists, before the polar ice caps. These areas are sparsely habited, as they are far from the natural habitat of the lizards.\n\nAbundant natural resources include high-quality iron, silver, coal, salt, and hydrocarbons suitable for use as spacecraft fuel, resulting in the capital having a thriving material economy. In addition, the planet is host to most lizard corporations and companies, and has become a large tourist destination for lizards and non-lizards alike. However, many visitors find the atmosphere on the planet oppressive once they arrive- owing to the large military presence and generally stuffiness of the local populace when compared with the more open colonies.\n\nTizira possesses three moons. The largest of its moons, Atrakor ("Night Sky Lord" in High Draconic) was famously bombarded by the TerraGov Expeditionary Corps during one of lizardkind\'s many wars with humanity, giving the Lord his distinctive scar. Colonies exist on all three moons, harvesting valuable minerals to sustain the lizard economy. A number of orbital habitats exist too, though their quality is dubious and critics of the government accuse them of using them as offworld slums to house the poor and destitute out of sight and out of mind.\n\nTourist Information:\n* The capital of Tizira is the city of Zagoskeld, translating to "Great Sea\'s Edge" from High Draconic. Its metropolitan area is home to around 1/16th of the planet\'s population. The city is home to the Imperial Family, whose palace overlooks the bay and is a popular tourist destination in the city. It\'s located on the Zagosk, or Great Sea, and as expected is also a major port city for intraplanetary trade.\n* Tizira is home to around 10 billion lizardpeople, making it the Empire\'s most populous planet. A further 500 million live in orbital habitats and in colonies on its three moons.\n* The urban density is highest around the oceans, with settlements further from water being smaller and less densely populated. Rural areas have survived the advancement to the space age, unlike on Earth.\n* The many wars of lizardkind have resulted in much of the ancient architecture of the planet being lost or ruined. The few remaining well preserved sites are now strictly guarded as cultural heritage sites. Zagoskeld\'s old city is one of the best preserved areas of Medieval Lizard architecture, and the Imperial Palace is a key example of this style.\n* While High Draconic is the official language of the Lizard Empire, officially around 2500 languages are recognised as still living by Lizard scholars. Strong cultural divides still cause issues for the central government, even centuries after unification.\n\n## Pelatakarna: The Iron Mountains\n\nFactoids:\n* Pelatakarna is an oddity amongst Tizira\'s former nations, being quite cold as far as permanently inhabited regions go. The reason for this is its incredibly rich iron mines- prior to space colonisation, Pelatakarna was the most iron-rich Tiziran nation by population, and provided much of the Old World\'s supply of iron and steel.\n* Pelatakarna is considered somewhat of a backwater as far as Tiziran former nations go. The Karna people are, as a collective, deeply religious, agrarian, and homely.\n* Pelatakarna is a small nation, with only four cities breaching the 100,000 population threshold: of these, the capital, Kiselle, is the most important, being a major centre of industry, mostly around the nation\'s primary export of construction steel and metal products, although it\'s also a hub of Tizira\'s financial businesses and computer science.\n* During the snowiest period of the year which makes up approximately 4 Tiziran months at the end of the year, much of Pelatakarna shuts down. During these periods, the Karna take an extended holiday, and spend the time at home, in front of the fire with their families, enjoying traditional food and drink and generally having a merry time. This gives the Karna a reputation internationally as lazy and listless.\n\nThe lands of the former Grand Ducal Confederation of Pelatakarna have, going back millenia, been sleepy. One of the few Tiziran regions to experience frequent snowfall, the ice-capped Iron Mountains were not an attractive place for settlers throughout history; or at least, that would have been the story, were it not for their rich veins of iron. This made the mountains a lucrative prize, but actually exploiting these resources was a challenge, and so the population within the peaks would be as small as to be practically nonexistant throughout Tizira\'s early history. Into the medieval period, however, as demand for iron grew and mining technology advanced, extraction from the Iron Mountains became not only possible, but crucial to the development of Anceld\'s many states. Following this, a number of intrepid frontiersmen from nearby regions began to expand into the mountains, founding settlements and laying the foundations of a new culture to emerge: the Karna people. Within a few centuries, the counties of the Karna people would confederate under the Grand Ducal Confederation of Pelatakarna, and a crucial Anceldish nation that would stand the test of time to unification was born.\n\nAs might be expected from snow-covered peaks, Pelatakarna has a low population, mostly clustered around the former confederation\'s major cities, although with a large rural agrarian population, who make their living growing hardy fruits and ranching cave crickets. The Karna people trend towards tradition; with one of the highest religious population of any former nation on Tizira, as well as a style of building that seems to have fallen directly out of Tizira\'s pre-industrial era, they pride themselves on upholding much of what the rest of Tizira has left behind, especially in the countryside. Naturally, the rest of the population of Tizira tends to view them as backwards and stuck in the past, unwilling to adapt to the new realities of the modern day.\n\n## Valys: A Nation of Two Halves\n\nFactoids:\n* Valys was, prior to the Valyse Inheritance, considered to be the strongest Anceldish nation, and was on track to eventually unite Tizira itself. This fact is not lost on the Valyse, who trend jingoistic and imperialist politically; although they mostly turn this outwards these days, being a stronghold for Sumalist thought and loyalists through and through to the parliament who uphold it.\n* Valyse culture was and is a very strong influence across the Anceld, having been a nexus of artistic development throughout the middle ages and giving rise to Tizira\'s largest film industry in the modern period.\n\n## Parseld: An Escape from Everything\n\nFactoids:\n* The breadbasket of Tizira, the former Parselder republic produces a truly incredible amount of food. Additionally, many Tiziran staples originated here, including\n\nThe discovery of Tizira\'s Parseld in the Era of Discovery was a major upset to the balance of power in the Anceld, with many of the leading nations there seeking to expand into the new, virgin territory found across the Zagosk.\n\nAfter winning its independence, the former territory of the Valyse Parseld took a new mantle: the Parseld Republic, ready to stand as a beacon of liberty and hope on Tizira. As time went on and industrialisation continued to sweep Tizira, many of those made redundant by the new technologies went to the Parseld in search of a better life, and brought their extensive knowledge of farming and craftsmanship with them to its fertile lands. Within a few decades, Parselder food production reached impressive peaks, and it never stopped growing from there.\n\nFrom its initial founding under agrarian ideals, and subsequent expansion under the labour of farmers might inform you, life in the Parseld has remained defiantly agrarian in the face of Tizira\'s moderisation. Much of its large landmass is sparsely populated, with small-town living and farming being the order of business. Near the coast, the fight to industrialisation was lost, however, and major cities stand, taking advantage of the vast wealth of resources of the continent.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:21:06', NULL, 28),
	(47, 'CentCom', 'Governments: The Tiziran Government', '# The Tiziran Government\n\n### Monarchy: \nThe reigning monarch of Tizira is the young Empress Arael-Rena I, notable for being the youngest crowned monarch in Tizira\'s unified history, having taken the throne at 17 after the sudden death of her father. Now 24, she is known for her idealism and belief in change, standing firmly opposed to Tizira\'s jingoism and entrenched social order.\n\nThe Empress is well known for her close cooperation with her twin brother Shal-Rena, although recently Shal has been away on military campaign in his position as an officer in the army.\n\nThe Empress\' early life was defined by rebellion. As a child, she had little interest in preparing to take the throne, instead preferring to spend her time away from the nobility and the royal lifestyle. Into her teenage years, this tranformed into sneaking out to spend nights with the commonfolk, giving her a unique perspective amongst the royal family into the life of an average Tiziran- as well as a disliking of the status quo of Tizira. After ascending to the throne, she began to push against the military establishment, using her now concerningly (to the powers-that-be) loud voice to advocate for increased galactic cooperation and an end to Tizira\'s jingoism. This, perhaps obviously, did not earn her many supporters amongst the higher eschelons of Tiziran political life and the military, who see her as a naive upstart that threatens their grip on power. However, it has made her a very popular figure amongst Tizira\'s war-weary and increasingly discontent population.\n\nThe Empress\' push against the parliament has lead them to throw their support behind another figure in the Tiziran monarchy: the Empress\' uncle, Geri-Rena, an accomplished military leader and firm supporter of the status quo. Geri has long held designs on the Tiziran throne, having envied his brother for being first in line, and now viewing his offspring as squandering it. This has lead to the rise of a movement amongst the Tiziran elite and more jingoistic population, the Black Birthright- seeking the removal of Arael and her replacement with Geri. The movement is small but powerful, being supported by a number of Tizira\'s more prominent nobility, old-money businesses, and most notably, a majority of the upper levels of the military.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 07:53:45', NULL, 28),

These larger divisions operate their own stations, conduct their own hiring and personnel management, and this has, in turn, resulted in internal conflict. Since each of them is ultimately beholden to the board, and in particular to their allocation of funding, each branch also finds itself needing to show itself to be the best- and in turn, that the rest aren\'t as worthy of cash. This, of course, leads to byzantine politics- much like unruly siblings fighting each other, the branches often devolve into petty infighting, or worse, actual violence like sabotage or subterfuge. Corporate is left with the unenviable task of trying to rule over this mess, and their solution is to essentially do nothing- so long as it isn\'t costing *Corporate* cash, anyway.', 'Reference', 'flashdim', '2024-04-21 08:40:44', NULL, 28),

NTHI is the company\'s most profitable division, being responsible for around 1/3rd of Nanotrasen\'s overall net worth, as well as managing Nanotrasen\'s extensive plasma empire. Most of the stations and outposts found in the frontier and in major industrial centres are operated primarily by NTHI, usually with some involvement by NTFID.\n\nNTHI\'s director is Heike Beissel. Elevated to the position due to her exemplary handling of operations at NTCS, Beissel is a company woman through-and-through; ruthless, profit-oriented, and willing to take almost any step necessary to ensure that NTHI is the foremost of Nanotrasen\'s divisions.\n\n## NTHI Subdivisions\n### NTCS (Nanotrasen Chemical Supply)\nField: Chemical Manufacture and Distribution\nAnother acquisition made in the early days of the company, NTCS began life as Texas Chemical, a major US-based chemical manufacturer. In the centuries since, it\'s grown to be one of humanity\'s largest chemical producers, although not large enough to secure its independence from NTHI. Today, NTCS is involved heavily in NTHI\'s plasma production, providing the various reagents required for the Altmeyer process. In addition, it produces a wide range of industrial and consumer chemicals, from battery acid through to petrochemicals.\n\n### General Energy\nField: Energy, Petrochemical, and Fuel\n\n\n# NTFID (Nanotrasen Futures and Innovation Division)\n> ***EXPANDING OUR HORIZONS***\nHeadquarters: NT Southwestern Campus, San Jose, California\nNanotrasen\'s research and development division, responsible for pushing humanity\'s scientific boundaries and being on the cutting edge of innovation. Naturally, NTFID acts as a significant source of funding for Nanotrasen\'s endeavours as a whole in the form of grants from TerraGov, as well as being a magnet for talent due to partnerships with research groups at universities across human space. Additionally, NTFID is a signatory and member of the Terran Joint Research Collective alongside many other major corporations. In theory, this should ensure that discoveries made by NTFID\'s researchers make their way into the collective knowledge of mankind rapidly. In practice, the collective sees very little of Nanotrasen\'s juiciest research, instead getting scraps or anything that management has deemed "no longer critical to maintain secrecy on". NTFID is based out of the Southwestern Campus at San Jose, although it also has major secondary sites at Houston, Busan, Dortmund and Adasta City, and a huge number of lesser facilities across pretty much all of human space.\n\nIn terms of land share within Nanotrasen\'s full organisation, NTFID comes in second place behind NTHI, operating a large number of facilities across human space, including several major sites on the peripheries. One of NTFID\'s notable sites is Space Station 13, which it will operate jointly with NTHI until the construction of a more permanent mining outpost on or around Indecipheres is finished, at which point the station will pass entirely into its ownership.\n\nNTFID\'s director is Mátyás Lórincz, who worked his way up through the ranks as a researcher and eventually into the upper echelons of management. Though driven and ambitious, Lórincz is also a true believer in the importance of science. This makes his role as the director of NTFID difficult, as he is often required to balance his genuine desire to drive scientific development and push the limits with his requirement to balance the budget and play the internal game of politics within Nanotrasen.\n\n## NTFID Subdivisions\n### New Horizons\nField: Surveying and Colonial Endeavours\n\n# NTHW (Nanotrasen Health and Wellbeing)\n> ***MAKING HEALTHIER LIVES***\nHeadquarters: Ishtar, Astarte, Alpha Centauri\nNTHW is Nanotrasen\'s medical subdivision, tasked with medical research, health insurance, production of medical goods, and operation of hospitals, clinics, and deathcare facilities across human space. Despite consistent profits, the division has fallen on hard times in recent years due to the Prosperity cloning scandal damaging public trust, and this has resulted in a reduction of funding from corporate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this hasn\'t exactly made NTHW\'s higher-ups happy, and their approach to both external and internal politics has become increasingly ruthless, with Director Claire Duchamp being desperate to reclaim the division\'s lost glory by any means necessary.\n\n## NTHW Subdivisions\n\n# NTCG (Nanotrasen Consumer Goods)\n> ***INNOVATIONS FOR A BETTER TOMORROW***\n\nHeadquarters: NT Asian Regional Headquarters, Busan, Korea\nNTCG is responsible for most of Nanotrasen\'s publically-sold products; under their broad heading is included consumer electronics, automotive, aerospace, as well as dozens of smaller companies with their own branding under the NT umbrella. As might be expected of the division that produces everything from alarm clocks to spaceships, coffeemakers to industrial drills, or games consoles to handguns, they exercise a great deal of power within NT\'s internal politics game and generate a lot of revenue for the corporation.\n\nNTCG is based out of Nanotrasen\'s Asian regional headquarters in Busan, Korea, in addition to operating extensive manufacturing across the human core territories, especially on the Moon, Adasta, San Garcia, and dozens of other planets. In the further reaches of human space, NTCG\'s presence is very limited: it\'s simply not economical to build factories on the frontiers versus manufacturing everything where the customers are. This is the key part that makes NTCG a smaller division than NTHI or NTFID- it\'s not that they don\'t make money, or that they don\'t have a lot of employees, it\'s that their geographic reach is limited by their profit motive.\n\n## NTCG Subdivisions\n### Trasen-Knox Scientific\nHeadquarters: NT Southwestern Campus, San Jose, California\nField: Scientific Computers and Analytical Equipment\nA legacy division of Nanotrasen, Trasen-Knox Scientific maintains the company\'s previous name, as well as its original purpose: high-grade scientific computing and analytical equipment. Operating under NTCG, Trasen-Knox doesn\'t make very much these days, but their products remain popular with the academic market, and the name still maintains some historical significance as the one that started the whole thing off.\n\nTrasen-Knox maintains its site at the Southwestern Campus, purchased by Michael and Dale as they expanded out of Dale\'s garage in Fresno into a real company. Even if most of the rest of the company\'s moved away, at least some of its history stays alive here.\n\n### Galaxywise Shipyards\nHeadquarters: Anderston Yards, Adasta Orbital\nField: General Aerospace\nMuch of Nanotrasen\'s strength as a megacorporation comes from their ability to practice what is essentially autarky- the production of all required goods from raw material to finalised item, with little to no reliance on external companies or factors. To this end, Galaxywise is critical to Nanotrasen\'s practice of autarky- from their orbital shipyards above Adasta, Nanotrasen is able to produce a wide range of important vessels, from small single-man scouting vessels to large-scale freighters and everything inbetween. Unfortunately for Nanotrasen, however, their autarky chain is broken by limitations imposed by TerraGov stating that only licensed corporations are capable of producing heavily armed vessels (the Merchant Marine Act states that any vessel capable of bearing armaments in excess of Class 2, the highest legal civilian grade, may be produced by licensed companies only)- a license Galaxywise has been unable to secure due to politicking by corporate rivals at the senate.\n\n### GEW (Global Engine Works)\nField: Vehicles\nGEW is one of the world\'s oldest engine works, having originated in the mid-1800s as a producer of railway steam engines. Into the 1900s, they broadened to aircraft, and then onto motorcars in the wake of the Second World War. After financial troubles in the early 2000s, they were acquired by Nanotrasen to further diversify the company\'s portfolio. GEW today is known for their bipolar range of vehicles, catering to both the lowest end of the market with budget options, and the extreme upper end with high-class supercars and luxury touring cars- in addition to maintaining their work on high-end aircraft engines. Additionally, their design expertise has been coupled into some of Nanotrasen\'s other companies, such as providing interior design for small luxury space vessels for ATA or atmospheric engine designs for Galaxywise.\n\n### ATA (Adasta Travaux Aérospatiaux/Adasta Aerospace Works)\nField: Luxury Aerospace\nIf Galaxywise is Nanotrasen\'s answer to the demand for reliable budget ships, ATA is their answer to the cries of billionaire corpos and top politicians: a shipyard based around the creation of bespoke, luxury vessels fit for royalty. Operating as part of the Galaxywise Shipyard Facility, ATA builds palatial vessels to the exacting demands of its clients, at extreme cost. No two ships built there come out alike.

Failure to comply with protocol risks company assets, personal legal protections, and personal safety. This form was designed for all standard class isolated stations (henceforth referred to as “the station”) populated by 20 - 80 personnel.  \nAn evacuation scenario is defined as a scenario in which the crew must abandon the station due to extreme risk to company assets. Company assets include precious raw material, personnel, proprietary technology, research data, weaponry, and network security.\n\n\n## Criteria for declaring an evacuation scenario\n\nEvacuation scenarios are declared when the assets of the station are at significant risk, and evacuation presents the best opportunity to protect station assets. These evacuations are called at the discretion of the commander in chief of the station (henceforth referred to as the captain,) or if applicable, the station\'s onboard artificial intelligence systems. \nIn the event of the captain of the station\'s casualty or abandonment, the duty of discretion falls to departmental heads of staff. Results of improper calls to evacuate may be met with termination, execution, and defamation.\n\n## Risks of evacuation\nAbandonment of the station leaves many important station assets especially vulnerable, all assets and crew left on the station are assumed lost. It may be a very long time before a salvage team is able to be fielded, assuming that the station has not been compromised by enemy agents, hostile lifeforms, or otherwise unsafe conditions. Failure to evacuate will result in your person being labeled “deceased” and all personal assets not accounted for being added to company general supply.\n\n## General responsibilities during an evacuation\nAll crew members should board the escape shuttle at the first available opportunity, provided they have no other significant responsibility to fulfill. If you are unable for some reason unable to reach the escape shuttle, they may opt for an emergency escape pod. The likelihood of rescue by means of escape pod is significantly lower, due to costs associated with search and rescue.\nIf a crewmember opts for an escape pod, the debt of the rescue operation will be owed by the crewmember. If the debt can not be paid immediately, Nanotrasen will deduct the cost from their wage until the debt is repaid.\n\n## Specific responsibilities during an evacuation\nThe following tasks should be accounted for prior to the departure of the escape shuttle.\n- The nuclear authentication disk must be secured on the person of the Captain (or head of staff in the event of the Captain\'s absence.)\n\n- All of the physical hard drives containing all collected research data must be brought to the escape shuttle, and uploaded to the shuttle’s internal data servers. The station side data servers must be wiped of all data. This is the responsibility of the station\'s research director.\n\n- Identified enemies of the corporation and other capital criminals held in indefinite detainment should be brought into the brig section of the shuttle for secure transport for interrogation and processing. This is the responsibility of the warden, and by extension all of the security team.\n\n- Valuable assets, which include but are not limited to, plasma, bluespace crystals, weaponry, station cyborgs, and the station artificial intelligence system, should be transported onto the shuttle. This is the responsibility of the station’s quartermaster.\n\nIn the event that there is no one to fulfill these obligations, the duty may be assigned by the captain.\n\n## In transit procedure.\nCrew members should remain calm and orderly in transit. It is important that you ensure your station ID is securely fastened and presented, otherwise a central command officer may recognize you as a foreign agent and dispatch you upon arrival.
